  Jack Torrance needs to get away, anywhere will do as long as he can have some peace and quiet. He needs to forget about getting fired from his job as a teacher for a violent assault, forget about his excess drinking, forget about having broken his young sons arm in a fit of uncontrolled anger and at least try and bury deep down his seething and uncontrollable resentment that his wife knows exactly what he really is, a drunken violent bully with a temper! Five months as a caretaker in a supposedly haunted and extremely empty Colorado hotel cut off from the outside world by deep snow sounds just about right. Perhaps he can write the great American novel, perhaps he can finish his long gesturing play, or maybe just maybe he will try to murder his family!Stephen Kings utterly fantastical supernatural novel introduces us, from page one, to one of his finest ever creations, the truly frightening Jack Torrence. On a par with the deranged nurse Annie Wilkes from Misery, Jack is a supremely complicated man who seems uncomfortable with the world around him, his high opinion of  himself and his intelligent is at odds with his inability to recognise or even accept his own deep and ultimately fatal personal flaws. Jack, like al Psychopaths, sees the world in terms of himself, and sees his son and wife as merely extensions of him, they live in his world and are expected to follow the rules as he sees them. He doesn't outwardly hate them but he doesn't love or really care for them either, he just seems to accept them as a necessary inconvenience that he just has to put up with to appear normal. It's his well practised outward projection of ordinariness that sets him apart from your run of the mill homicidal killer, he's the kind of person you don't notice, the guy who mows his lawn and takes out the trash, the guy who takes his kid to the park, the guy who is always pleasant and says hello. However there is something old and ugly hiding in Jack Torrence, something from his past, something rotten, something extremely dangerous, something deadly waiting to emerge.Although The Shining is at heart a variation on a “ghost story”, King's ability to present the reader with real and credible (if horrible) characters lifts this novel to a higher plane. Jack's tortured and often very unpleasant internal narrative peppers the text and even interrupts his own lines of dialogue and in doing so we see him in a much broader light. We see what he is saying and also know what he is really thinking in real time. We know he lies, we know he is weak and frustrated, we know he does not respect or love his wife and we know of his true feelings, those he keeps well hidden possible even from himself.Some have said rather unfairly that it's not “very scary” or words to that effect. It is certainly true that some of the book is about Jacks early life and it does take some time to set the stage. However once set the terror builds as Jack becomes more unstable and unpredictable. The true horror of possible living with an undiagnosed and extremely dangerous psychopath who believes ghosts are communicating with him to kill his family becomes very real. As his and Danny's visions become more “real” the fight for survival intensifies as does the pace of the book. I found it very scary, not for the ghosts but Jack's inability to hold onto reality.Whether the hotel really does have “demons” that can affect a weak and easily dominated mind or the “demons” are his own fully formed ready for use in the right circumstances is a debate for another time. King thought one way (the hotel was haunted) and that Jack was a victim. Kubrick the other (the hotel was just a hotel) and Jack was a Psychopath, however which ever way you side it's a grand ride finding out.I have always felt that Kings earlier work (pre 1995) was his best. This his third novel is probably his second best novel after The Green Mile and that is saying something.Enjoy.

  Having watched Stanley Kubrick's film 'The Shining' several times I was persuaded by all the enthusiastic revues (the Book's better than the Film) to read the Stephen King novel it's based on. Lets be clear about this, I'm not adverse to long novels, I read Leo Tolstoy's 'War and Peace' (1400 pages) in my twenties, (a long time ago) but whereas Tolstoy's novel covered a vast amount of material, plus very interesting characters, King's book is exasperatingly 'long winded' more than half it's length could of been trimmed to better effect. I had assumed the 'scary bits' in the movie were taken from the book, when in fact none of them were, topiary animals coming to life 'aren't' scary, though Mr King obviously thinks they are, reviving them again and again throughout the novel undermining what tension there is in the book and culminating in a ludicrous/hilarious encounter between Hallorann (arriving at the 'Overlook' to confront a very 'real' madman) and a 'HEDGELION !!!' Fire extinguisher's aren't scary either in fact unforgivably King's book isn't particularly frightening. So I'm going to state (blasphemously) that the film IS better than the book !! ......... try hedgehogs next time ...

  I really enjoyed the 1980's film version starring Jack Nicholson, and i kind of figured that there would be a few differences, but after reading the book i realised that the film is way off base from Stephen King's book, and it's no wonder that SK was so famously outspoken as to his dislike of the film. But there is a 1990's television mini series that I've heard hits closer to the mark that I've yet to see. This is a review of Stephen King's novel, NOT the film or the television mini series.Danny Torrance is a young boy with psychic abilities, when his recovering alcoholic father gets a job as the winter caretaker of the remote Overlook Hotel Danny and his mother go with him. Danny's visions of horrible events that happened at the hotel in it's past start as they are being shown around and he knows that the Overlook hotel is a bad place to be.As the winter snow comes in, cutting the family of from civilization, Danny's father's behaviour becomes more erratic and unpredictable and eventually dangerous for Danny and his mother.With ghosts, visions and psychological horror, the Shining by Stephen King is a VERY good horror story, I would say one of his best, right up there with the likes of Salems Lot which is another SK novel that i recommend if you enjoy horror.Stephen King has also written Doctor Sleep which is The Shining book two.I give The Shining 5 well deserved stars.

  I had never had the chance to pick up the novel before yet I had seen the film a couple of hundred times I had understood there was some very big differences between the book and film and that king wasn't happy with the end product of the film as so much was left out after getti g the book and giving it a read this is an unrelenting story that's about as far from the cinema production as you can get ig ore the film yes its a classic masterpiece yet the book is so much more its compelling the writing is sub par the words flow so well its very natural to read and digest I don't want to give anything away but it's a must read for anyone who loves the shining stephen king or supernatural thrillers/horror novels you won't regret it I know I didn't and was kicking myself for not doing it sooner

  This is my sixth (and the last) book of Stephen King in row.I am bit tired of reading endless side stories  and characters with empty dialogues with the same Middle Class American English.They are absolute disengager. (examples: IT, THE STAND (uncut version) )However, this novel is sort of free of them because it is taking place in a closed environment among a few people.There is not much space to introduce unrelated characters with loads of side dialogues, descriptions.SK's narrative is good when he sticks to a one line of story flow, which is usually in a suspense sphere, and a few characters.When I watched  The Shining (an adaptation movie), my initial view was that it was horror / thriller movie that makes your hair stand on.But when I read the book, I felt that movie was missing very important  moral story; Genealogy of psychology.Moral story of the book is what parents are doing to their kids is what their own parents did to them.This is wonderfully put by Wendy's (Danny's mother) thoughtIn fact, weird suspense coming from of Jack's (Danny's father) abusive character starts from the right beginning before they move to the hotel.Same goes for his mother's troubles coming from her own mother.In fact, Jack's abuse reaches its climax at the hotel.His is possessed by the ""evil"" spirit of the hotel.But maybe, Jack was long ago possessed as a result of his trauma by his father.Maybe he was going to the same thing on another place.I think SK's success in horror come from the his narration of his dream/nightmares instead he is writing a horror fiction out of blue air. (That would feel always artificial)Horror dreams are always weird, awkward, unclear, aren't they?And that's is also what you feel in SK's novels. I think The Shining could be best example of it.And I think what makes SK's books selling millions is that his weird, awkward dreams coupled with his ferocious story telling.

  After years of planning to read The Shining, I finally got around to it and it was definitely worth the wait. Stephen King is a master storyteller and all his other books I've read have been fantastic, The Shining is just the same. I had times when I wanted to hide because it that scary. If you liked this book, I'd definitely suggest reading Doctor Sleep (which I some how read before this) but it's another great story of Danny and where his life takes him.
"

  I know, I know. I am mentally kicking myself even as I write this. Forgive me Stephen. You are the undisputed king of horror. An incredible writer and this is one fine story, everybody knows.  As a writer myself I should know better, but seriously, in this instance. I prefer the film. I cannot relate to this Jack at all. Half of the time, I can't even understand him. And those bush animals? Too silly for words. But read it, it's Stephen King. The master, and it's a classic.

  A fantastic read. I have to admit to not having been a fan of Stephen King in my younger days but in the last year I have read Carrie, The Dead Zone and now The Shining. I have always enjoyed the movie and always wondered why King was so dismissive of Kubrick's interpretation. Having now read it I can see why.So very different and the characters have so much more depth. I appreciate that they can't always be picked up from a film but even so the book give the Torrance family so many more layers to make them that little bit more believable and interesting.The speed in which the events turn in the final third means you genuinely don't want to stop reading.BRILLIANT!

  How many times do you find that the book is much better than the film?  I thought it would be hard to beat the film of The Shining, but whilst the film is still an absolute classic, the book goes one better. Of course the basic story line is all there, but the book is quite different: if you think there's no point reading the book because you've seen the film so many times, think again.  There's so much more insight into the characters and the background to the tale.  I'm going to be moving on shortly to the book versions of the other King movie classics - go buy this book, it's a great read.

  Not King's best book that's for sure.  The movie was fantastic, the book average, which is something that I find rarely happens.  What killed the book for me was the hedge animals and the fire hose, both were utterly ridiculous and killed the horror for me.  If they had included the hedge animals in the movie it would have flopped.  I also found the way Danny's thoughts were written to far too adult to have been the thoughts of a 5 year old child.  All in all, I would not recommend this book, it was about 2 hours too long and was too silly and far fetched in parts to make it entertaining/scary.

  The Shining - Stephen King's novel gives us more background and detail into the character of Jack Torrence than does the film. His alcoholism and short temper are the themes running throughout the novel.Despite these shortcomings, Torrence starts out a decent family man. That is until the Overlook Hotel takes over his weak personality and plays on his fears and demons. He has taken a job as winter caretaker in the deserted hotel - deserted as it closes for winter due to being cut off by the snow.Jack gradually succumbs to the evil influence of the Overlook which wants him to harm his wife and son. This he sets about in no uncertain terms.The iconic memories of The Shining come from the film and are not present in the book. King gives us a straight forward mystery. Kubrick's acclaimed cinematic version takes the bare bones of the novel and gives us a multi layered mystery.It's no secret that King didn't like the screen adaptation of his novel - at least in the beginning although he has mellowed towards it in recent years calling it a ""deeply unsettling cinematic experience in it's own right."" And in his book 'Danse Macabre' he cites it as a notable contribution to the horror genre and lists it as one of his favourites!A very good read - but although I love this book I prefer the movie.
"
"
  I actually started with Dr. Sleep, the sequel to this, then I saw the film and was outraged at how it differed from the references in Dr. Sleep.This reminds me very much of the way The Exorcist slowly builds up - odd happenings and ""maybes"" - the intensity grows and Overlook comes to true life. Brilliantly done. I can even look at the film in a better light now. It may take some liberties with the novel, but it does bring some of the very subtle frights of the book much more into the open.People who are suggestible will never go near a hedge again.
"
"
  I'll keep this short and sweet: I assumed the creepiest parts of Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining came from the book, but they didn't. Instead there are topiary animals that come to life, which just didn't work as well for me. The book was also overly long. It was atmospheric and I enjoyed the way Jack's character develops, but it just made me want to watch the film again, which had so many layers I could dissect it all day long.
"
"
  I had heard of Stephen King, I had seen some of the movies based on his books but I had never actually read anything by him. I was absolutely blown away by this novel. It was part of my class curriculum and I ended up writing one of my highest graded essays for my degree on The Shining. It definitely gave me the Stephen King bug, i've gone on to read IT and am currently reading Doctor Sleep, the sequel to The Shining.

  After finally getting round to reading The Shining, I can’t believe it has taken me so long! A lot has been made about this being one of the scariest books ever, I remember the “Friends” episode in particular where Joey has put it in the freezer because he is so scared, so I think I’d put it off when I was younger and read lots of his other books because I thought it would be too scary.  Can’t believe I waited so long now!  I guess the scare factor in books is relative to the people reading it because although I found parts of it quite sinister and I was desperately hoping the characters would be okay, I didn’t find it so scary I had to stop reading or anything.The characterisation in “The Shining” is brilliant.  We see glimpses of Jack Torrance’s past and this builds a picture of this quite normal man who is struggling with Alcoholism and the memories of his violent father.  I think this makes his descent into madness at the hands of The Overlook hotel all the more chilling.  At the start of the book he is desperate to make a fresh start, get his play finished and keep away from alcohol.  This is a stark contrast to the Jack Torrance we meet at the end of the book.When we first meet Wendy Torrance she comes across as a fairly weak woman who has gone from being dominated by her Mother to being dominated by her husband.  She loves her son desperately but still stays with Jack after he breaks Danny’s arm in an alcohol fuelled rage.  By the end of the book she is ready to fight to keep her son safe, whatever the hotel throws at them.I found Danny Torrance to be a really interesting character; as such I’m looking forward to starting “Doctor Sleep” to find out what has happened to him since “The Shining”.  He is highly psychic and it seems that the psychic phenomena that had already been going on at The Overlook is sent into overdrive by Danny’s presence.  At only 6 years old in “The Shining” it will be interesting to see how these events have shaped his adult life and how he has dealt with everything that happen, if at all.  There is also the spectre of alcoholism and the fact that it is often a hereditary condition.  Will Danny also be struggling with alcohol dependence like his Father and Grandfather before him?I really enjoyed “The Shining” and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the thriller/horror genre.  I wouldn’t say it’s a straight out horror, there isn’t lots in the way of blood and gore, its more the sinister build up that make the book as creepy as it is.

  Critically acclaimed British horror writer, Peter Straub, once described this novel as ""obviously a masterpiece, probably the best supernatural novel in a hundred years!"" I don't think a better statement could have been conjured to enforce the true genius of this novel, Stephen King's third published novel, a novel that is a far cry from his first published attempt, ""Carrie"".I think everyone who has been alive for at least the last twenty, if not ten years, knows of Kubrick's 1980 adaptation of the novel, an adaptation in which Mr Kubrick took a lot of liberties, and ignored a lot of what Stephen King had written in his fantastic novel. I was one of the lucky people to have read the novel before I watched the film because the film is so different, there could be a lot of disappointment for reading the novel after watching the movie.There have been many great haunted house/hotel novels in the past: Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is one of the greats that comes to mind, but there is something different and more reality-based about ""The Shining"", and I think this comes from the brilliance King enthuses his three main characters with when he writes about them. Most haunted house stories have a company of about four different people, most of whom don't know each other, are innocent within their own lives, and have to face up to a fear that is supernatural. In ""The Shining"", the three main characters are a family, known as the Torrance's: Father (Jack), Mother (Wendy) and Son (Danny). Jack is an ex-alcoholic who gets a job as winter caretaker for the heavily pristine Overlook Hotel, one of the greatest American hotels in the last century. He will bring his family with him to stay over the winter months - they will be snowed in, they won't be able to get out without help from park rangers, if they are able to make it through the snow, and they are not alone.The title of the novel comes from a gift that Danny has - he is susceptible to people's thoughts and emotions as well as to the past and future of his surroundings. He is able, through his gift, to sub-consciously awake the hotel's past horrors - those that have died or been murdered, that are now permanent residents of the hotel that want Danny's gifts for their own terrifying purposes and they don't care who they have to get through to get to Danny.This would have been a very horrific process of story-writing had King just decided to use this as the basis for his novel, but this is Stephen  King we are talking about and Stephen King is not a normal writer - he is a genius, up there in the Dickens class as a storyteller, as some critics have put it. Jack has an alcohol problem and a violent temper. He has already broken up his son's arm in one of his rages before the story has even begun, and the horrors of his alcoholic addiction play a large premise towards the horrors of the story and the way in which the Overlook uses him for their own ends.  Not only this, but he has a history of watching his own father as an abuser, someone who took a cane to his wife and, in simple terms, smashed her up. It is these terrifying experiences that make this one of the greatest horror novels ever written, and in my own humble opinions, it ranks for me, as perhaps one of the greatest American novels of the post-war period.This is the novel that made Stephen King a true star and set him on his way to being the most popular novelist of his generation. ""Carrie"" and ""'Salem's Lot"" had sold very well as paperbacks, but now King had a hardcover bestseller on his hands. The world was now his oyster, and as a writer, he could do anything he wanted.I can still remember the first time I read ""The Shining"" and how much fun I had with it. It is a very deep novel, a novel written by someone who has now found his craft and truly understands it. He is not just telling a story that will scare his readers - he is approaching the method of this art with his own demons and his own thoughts and teachings. Stephen King was an alcoholic himself at this point, battling with his own fears, as a writer and as a father and family man. This comes through a lot in the novel. The character of Jack Torrance seems to be Stephen King himself, in a parallel universe, a Stephen King who had allowed his fears to get the better of him, to have never had a wife who had retrieved ""Carrie"" from the dustbin, urging him to complete it. King is not afraid to admit his own faults and fears, and I think that is another genius of his writing. A lot of authors would never admit to their demons and if they had written ""The Shining"", it would just have been another haunted hotel novel that might have passed through the boundaries of time and gone on to become just a good story. But King has made this into a masterpiece and it is a novel that can be read again and again, allowing the reader to discover something different each time they fly through the pages. Kubrick might have made a great movie, but he took out all that made this novel important, and I think King was right in his criticism of Kubrick's adaptation for all them years.If you want to really understand ""The Shining"", don't see the movie first - read the novel and you will not need to worry, because your guide for this great journey will be the true genius master, Stephen King himself. For me, it is certainly one of my favourite novels that has ever been written, and in a hundred years when we are all dead (hopefully not haunting the Overlook Hotel), this book will still be read and still be thought of as not just a great horror story, but a great American classic!

  So much has been written about ""The Shining"" over the years and after Stanley Kubrick 's iconic adaptation of the book people don't often remember what a great book it is.It's not the same as the film which dumbed the characters down into caricatures. Jack Torrance is a failed writer, husband, father, trying to recover from alcoholism. His wife Wendy is trying to believe in him and his desire to change. Danny their 5-year-old son has ""the shining"" - a psychic ability to sense things and read feelings and emotions, though he doesn't understand itJack takes on the job of winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel as a last-ditch attempt to finish writing a play and keep his family together. But the place has a malign power and gradually all his good intentions are overwhelmed and he degenerates into a dangerous maniac.Danny's shining becomes more of an issue as the hotel's inmates try to scare him away. His mother realises that her husband is cracking up but cannot escape because the snow comes and blocks them in.Such a well-written and atmospheric book. Do read it and forget Shelley Duvall's Wendy in the film. I'm looking forward to reading Dr Sleep

  Telecommunication, precognition and spirits what is not to love? The story of young Danny Torrance shows you truly how much of a curse it can be to know what people think, to know what is yet to happen and the effect of what such a great power can do to the dead. Focused on the way the mind can work this book will certainly get inside you head and make all your childhood fears seem very real, is everything happening just one big hallucination or is it very real? If it isn't real then how come they seem so and can do so much terrorizing damage to an individual?! In this novel you will learn just how horrible solitude can be, after all no one can hear you scream!

  Having read quite a few Stephen King books as a teenager, jump forward 25-odd(!) years later, I realised I hadn't actually read The Shining. I've seen the movie numerous times and consider it one of my favourites. So how could I consider myself a true fan of The Shining when I've only seen the movie and not read the book?! Feeling like a fraud, I promptly bought the Kindle version.Reading Stephen King again after so long was like revisiting your old home town where you grew up – it seems so familiar and strangely comforting (although the content of the book may not make you feel comfortable!).Because of the movie, I basically knew everything that was going to happen in the novel. But it still scared me, shocked me and freaked me out (as a good Stephen King novel ought to). I'm so glad I decided to go back and finally read this. Mr King sure knows how to write a good horror story.
"

  Stephen King, the master story teller does it again!  The Shining is an engrossing, multi-faceted supernatural novel which explores everything from alcoholism to domestic abuse, marital and familial relations and mental vulnerability.  It’s sinister and unsettling but totally absorbing.  King at his finest.
"
"
  I have only ever previously read King books not made into films as I preferred to not know the storyline, however, they were never very good..probably why. The Shining however is proof of Kings talent and a great example of a horror story that is more about the horrors that exist in the mind than outside it. The gradual breakdown of Jack Torrence and his  internal struggle is brilliantly portayed in this book, as is the internal world of his son Danny. I liked how the majority of this book was actually from Danny's perspective (unlike the film) and that Wendy isn't the pathetic wife the film portrays her as being. The story is actually well constructed and simple with few diversions from the core plotline, which enables the story to continuously move forward to what you can see is the inevitable conclusion to the book. Great read.
"
"
  I've read a lot of Stephen Kings books (currently in the middle of Revival) and I will probably admit that this is still my favourite out of them all so far, I really liked the film but the book beats it easily, I think I read it in only a couple of days and was so glued to it I was reading it while cooking dinner! Anyone thinking of giving this a go I would highly recommend it, it's a classic for a reason :)
"
"
  I love this book. If you've seen the Stanley Kubrick film, be prepared for something completely different here. King's novel is much more atmospheric, much deeper, and even scarier. The first quarter of the book does a great job at letting you get to know the characters and really care for them. I found myself thinking that if I didn't know that it was about to get scary, I wouldn't mind the rest of the book simply exploring the family's relationships with each other. I was completely involved with the plot from the start.Then of course the horror kicks in. This isn't some cheap, easy ""Someone/thing is out to get you"" type of horror - it's deeply psychological and very unsettling. Without giving anything away, my favourite part was the bit with the elevator...It's extremely well written too; there's a reason Stephen King is the top guy in the industry and has been for the past however many years. The combination of superb writing and gripping story made this my favourite novel of all time.If you want to read this purely even to see the differences between this and the film which I now hate, go ahead! King himself stated in a very recent interview with the BBC that he hated the film because it was ""cold"" and ""didn't invite the viewers inside"". Kubrick also completely changed the story, but that's enough about the film for now...As King said himself in that interview - ""Love creates horror"".

  the shining is one of those stories that develop to an interest that hold you in suspense of fear and excitement. Sadly watched the film before reading the book but  the the book and the film ha e their own unique twists.I have always enjoy the writings of Stephen King from his older works to his modem novels, always a good Christmas present <U+0001F601>

  Like most people who enjoy this genre, I saw the film version years ago and the story tends to remain with you for some time as Jack Nicolson's portrail of Jack Torrance descent into madness was captivating. Many years on and with the emergence of SK's Dr Sleep, I thought I had better read The Shining before moving onto to Dr Sleep. Whilst the film generally follows the the book plotline, the book is 100% better and some. I can't believe (as many people probably!) that I have not read this classic sooner. The intensity of writing is SK at his best, building into and an absolutely nail biting, exhausting finale. So much more here than the film offered, albeit a good effort. One bonus however is that Jack Nicolson is in the mind's eye the perfect image of Jack Torrance - outstanding casting (no offence intended to Mr Nicolson of course).This book belongs on everybodys' bookshelf.

  The Shining by Stephen KingThe Shining is Stephen King's third book, published in 1977 and it is about a family that move into a hotel for the winter, only to find out that the hotel is not only haunted, but it comes to life and tries to kill off the family.I'm going to be honest, I thought the book was pretty good. It's one of those books where, even though nothing gripping happens, it somehow keeps you interested enough to read on. The fact that I read this book in 4 days shows that it DOES keep the reader interested.There is however one pretty big negative aspect to this book - I felt that some parts of the book were overdrawn and had some unnecessary details. I agree that this book is one of those stories where a slow build up to the climatic end is more necessary, but I feel Stephen King overwrote some parts and added unneeded details which is why this book can, at times, be boring.Generally speaking however, I did enjoy the book and I would recommend it to any horror fans or anyone looking to get into Stephen King.I'd personally give it a 6.5/10
"
"
  I have in the past dabbled with the idea of reading The Shining and something put me off. I think it was perhaps the hype and acclaim that surrounded it or the fact that the film really creeped me out when I was younger. The book should be treated as its own entity and it is fantastic.It is creepy, eerie, atmospheric and at times bleak, but it also tackles issues that effect all of us.Even if you aren't into horror books you should give this a chance!
"
"
  Well, no wonder they call him the king of terror (ah, puns) — he sure delivers and owns his title. The Shining is raw and surprisingly human in spite of the supernatural aspects of the plot. I’ll never be able to look at Jack Torrance as a victim or sympathize with him in general, not even after King showed that good old Hallorann could be corrupted. Jack was dislikeable from the start—arrogant, drowned in self-pity and constant thoughts that the world owed him something, ungrateful, etc. I noticed a couple avoidable clichés, but other than that, this book is amazing.
"
"
  The classic novel by the master of horror touches crucial human issues, like drinking, anger and mental well-being, and at times it does so very profoundly. The closer the story gets to the grand finale, however, the more fantasy and detached from such issues it becomes. Supernatural elements become too explicit to be really sinister and frightening. More subtlety and ambiguity would have added to the disquieting potential of the book.
"
"
  This is a must read! Ever since I had watched the movie, I wanted to read the book that was behind it all. I cannot express how glad I am that I did. I don't think you can really compare the movie and the book as they are both different but both good in their own way. However, I must say that I did prefer the book. It took me around 2 months to read, and honestly I didn't want it to end; I was hooked. King does a great job in delivering a good scare. You get a much better and deeper insight to the characters of Jack, Danny and Wendy as well as a deeper insight into their relationships, unlike the film. I simply cannot recommend this book highly enough. Read it - you won't be disappointed!

  An early story for the pen of one of the greatest horror fiction writers of all time.The Shining is a dark psychological thriller that really grabs the reader from page 1 and is written in such a way it is almost impossible to put the book down.Anyone who has seen the movie knows the basic premise of the story but in my opinion to fully appreciate this masterpiece you have to read the book (I didn't like the movie so I am a little biased).Perfect time to read (or reread in some cases) this with the upcoming release of it's follow up 
"
"
  This review does not describe the book, similar to another buyer, my book is covered in ink blotches. I've only noticed this almost 1 year after purchase (goes to show how I actually need to read more)
"
"
  I love The Shining, and have read it numerous times - so I thought that to have it on audio would be great! All started well, but the reader's voice is so monotonous that it becomes tedious, and for some reason the chapters are all over the place and not in order. This may be my Kindle going mad of course, but it is annoying.
"
"
  One of the most exciting books I have ever read. I couldn't sleep for two days but not because of fear. I was so excited about what was going to happen in the end that I was not able to relax until I finished. I'm not a native speaker yet Stephen King is quite easy to read even after a tiring workday. I'm planing to read the sequel 'Doctor Sleep' as well (sorry about the spoiler; a sequel presupposes that not all will die in The Shining).

"
  This story is an excellent purchase with more than just meets the eye of a story but an entrance into a world of macabre that is just so Stephen King. The best author possibly in the world. I definitely recommend this book.
"
"
  I saw Stanley Kubrick's movie version of The Shining when it was released in 1980, but it's taken me another 34 years to get round to reading Stephen King's original story. I'm glad I did. The novel is far richer and more rewarding. We really get to appreciate the family dynamics; we get the history of Jack Torrance's alcoholism, linked to his own father's bullying; we learn about the fact that he once broke his son Danny's arm and how this led to him quitting the booze; despite all this Danny loves his father deeply, and mom Wendy is jealous that her son is closer to his father than to her. Yet when Jack takes a job at The Overlook hotel in the Colorado mountains, deserted during the winter season, things start to change. Danny, who has ""the shine"", is first to sense and see the ghosts of past occupants. While sifting through old documents Jack discovers that the hotel has a sinister history, with connections to The Mob, and numerous violent deaths that have been hushed up. Then Jack starts to change, becoming a threat to his family, only it isn't really Jack - he is being controlled by The Overlook Hotel, and it wants Danny...If you already saw the movie, it is worth knowing that not only is this a deeper story but the ending is different too.
"
"
  Well I have always wanted to read this book. I loved the film and the book didn't disappoint. It was nice having some background on Jack and what he was like before he got to the Overlook hotel. I can't wait to read the prequel.Enjoy
"
"
  Thought I'd re read this as I'd recently read the follow up,, Dr Sleep, its a great book, differs from the film, and personally I like the read better than the film. But it's a classic. If you've only ever seen the film, I recommend that you read the book.
"
"
  I ain't very good at these,never know what to put so I will just say that it is one of kings finest,the characters are  so well written,I didn't connect with the characters in Salem's lot but love the characters in the shining,love the way King builds his stories into  a frantic crescendo,great book.
"
"
  I've read this book and pretty much everything mr king has written but for me this will always be his greatest work.The characters are immense, the story is powerful and wonderful, just everything about it is perfect.Read this book but don't watch the film it's shockingly bad in my opinion
"
"
  I loved this book!I have just recently started to read Stephen King books, this is the 6th and one of the best so far - along side Misery.70% of the way through the book (from then onwards) was the most scariest and fast paced part. By that part I couldn't stop reading until the book was finished.I just really wish that I had read the book before seeing the film, because I kept thinking 'this didn't happen in the film' or I was probably just expecting it to be similar to the film. But the lack in similarity isn't a disappointment at all, both the book and the film are great but quite different. I would just advise...If you have seen the film try not to compare them too much.
"
"
  The problem I have with Stephen King's novels is the genre. King is brilliant at drawing believable characters, at building tension and at pulling the reader into his world; but then he just has to spoil it all by introducing animate hedge animals, ghouls in baths, a dog possessed by the spirit of a serial killer, a hand reaching from a hedge etc etc, and  the whole believable universe of the fiction collapses. The Shining, Cujo, Black House et al, work perfectly well without this silliness. if he would only stop trying to appeal to thirteen year olds, Stephen King could be a truly great novelist.
"
"
  I read this when it first came out and a couple times more - why buy a book if not to read? His writing did improve of course but the story is still good and doesn't feel dated. Splendid read.
"
"
  I bought this book along with IT during the quarantine and not matter what anyone says reading the books will never get old , Time flew once I got into it and made quarantine much more bearable
"
"
  Outstanding story which is so different to the film and, despite my love of that, far superior too. The end and the deterioration of Jack make a lot more sense. Scary characterisation of Jack too. There's a lot of ordinary in there which makes you think how close we all come to the edge of sanity at times.
"
"
  Great book about a family looking after a haunted hotel in the mountains in the winter isolated by snow with no contact to the outside world except a CB radio,  the father Jack Torrence an ex alcoholic and school teacher takes the job as caretaker and is possessed by the hotel trying to keep them all as permanent residents but especially the boy Danny Torrance as he has a special ability to add to the hotels haunting powers,one of Stephen Kings best.
"
"
  I have seen the film countless times and always considered it to be very good, but I had never read the book, even though I have read all Stephen King's other books.  What could I read about that the film hasn't already shown me? Well how wrong was I? this story is fantastic and I have enjoyed every minute of it.... I found it interesting to read about Danny after reading Dr Sleep.  The book is so much better than the film and the characters completely different I can now understand why Stephen King was not a fan of the film! If you have not read this before then I urge you to give it a try.......
"
"
  Having been a very big fan of It I thought I may as well read this as everyone knows it’s supposed to be brilliant, and that it is! A captivating experience to read this book, the development of Jack is brilliant! Any thriller fan will enjoy this!
"
"
  Took me a while to get into this one but, after page 100 (a slow burner for me!) it was an addictive read. Indulging on this whilst on holiday alone in  huge, semi-deserted hotel  in a more deserted town, I can honestly say it was one of the most terrifying things I've ever read in my life.Creepy and chilling, the nastiness of the story is that the little boy is just five and King's writing makes it so easy to see each hideous event through little Danny's eyes. A great place to start for new King readers and, for those who are already fans and haven't read, what are you doing? You should be ashamed, download it now or they'll be redrum.
"
"
  Brilliant author - one of my favourites in fact.Bought as part of a secret Santa as we are buying our favourite books!Cannot recommend this enough!
"
"
  I bought The Shining to read before I read Doctor Sleep, Stephen King's follow up to The Shining.  I have watched the film with Jack Nicholson several times and still find it terrifying.  However, the book is infinitely better - there is much more depth to the characters and although it is still a 'horror' story, there is much to understand that really didn't come through in the film.  I would recommend this to anyone who, like me, knows the film and not the book.  Definitely a 5 star rating.
"
"
  I love the film. I love the book. The two begin with the same premise, however the book is infinitely more satisfying. This is the story the way it's meant to be. The movie is an absolute classic and follows its own path but the the book is a lot deeper. The characters are treated in a more sympathetic way and even Jack Torrance has a warmth and realism. Brilliant, chilling and inspiring. This is how all suspense stories should be written, full of believable characters caught up in extraordinary events.
"
"
  Having seen the film first and being a fan of the other films based on his books, this is the first of his books I have read and boy what a read.The film pales in comparison as I suspected it would.I loved reading all the different perspectives throughout and actually felt sorry for Jack and I found myself hoping against hope he would make it. Even with the 3-4 different perspectives it wasn't a complicated read and was easy to follow.Captivating and creepy :)I'm going to start reading his new instalment to the shinning, can't wait.
"
"
  I watched the film years ago, when I was young enough to be scared by it. The book had a creeping psychological effect and was quite chilling, in a very different way to the film. It's an interesting concept that hotels have a history. If that hotel is around long enough, tragedy and dastardly deeds are bound to come-a-knocking, right? And what if those events left their mark? A karmic stain, just the right circumstances for evil to flourish. A modern classic that I really enjoyed reading.
"
"
  Brilliant, suspense filled page-turner. Very well crafted characters and scenes. A cracking example of Stephen King. Keep a light on.
"
"
  Quick delivery.
"
"
  A freight train of a story it starts with the rails vibrating and a hum, the occasional blast of the horn to make you jump. You know it's coming but you can't be dragged away from the inevitable. The thundering, crashing crescendo as it rolls over you. Then the slightly sad, empty feeling as it rolls away, just a memory....but wait. I hear another train a-coming. Dr Sleep is on it's way. I revel in the challenge of a Stephen King novel trying to guess the twist and turn of the plot ahead of time. Not for the squeamish or delicate soul but always, always gripping.
"
"
  I avoided Stephen King for nearly forty years because, snobbishly, I believed him to be 'just' a horror writer. Despite the exhortations of three of my well read children, I stubbornly refused to read anything he had written. I finally gave in and read '11.22.63' and the result? Totally hooked. He is a man who can bring a character alive in just a few strokes of his pen, an author who can pin you to the back of your chair until you have finished. 'The Shining' is a remarkable book, totally stunning. There's horror,  yes, but real vulnerable people faced with credible horrors, some of their own making, some in the creative mind of this man of great talent - The hotel, the snow, the lift, the hedge animals, little Danny with his psychic gift... read it as soon as you can. And if you haven't read Stephen King before, throw away your prejudices before you start.
"
"
  I can’t watch scary films but I had no problem reading this.  Lovely covers and an absolutely great story.  Read the book in three days.  I highly recommend.
"
"
  I first read this book as a young lad many years ago, but not so many that I didn't remember the fear it brought to me. Time is a funny thing because this time round it scared me for a whole different bunch of reasons. It's a weird thing to read the same thing twice with a gap of 20ish years and get two completly different stories out of it. I won't go into details for those of you who are finding this book for the first because this is a simple story told by a young man who was possibly going through some of the very things depicted, we write what we know after all!Give it a go as I personally think this is one of Kings classics. The characters are painfully real at times and as you take the ride with them there are more than a few very uncomfortable moments.The maturity of Kings latest works isn't here, there is the raw power of a man struggling to make ends meet, and be a better person. There is the attempt at shock and awe.And 99% of the time it works perfectly.A must for all dedicated King addicts and those dwindling amongst the population who are only coming to King now!
"
"
  I love this book , I used to own the  paperback.  Stephen King is an amazing author and this is one of his best works
"
"
  After reading and watching Ready Player One, I felt I need to read The Shining. So glad I did. Amazing
"
"
  I read this only recently, having loved the Shining 2 book for a long time. I loved this just as much.
"
"
  After watching Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining, I decided to give the book a go, thinking that it would be quite similar. As it turned out, I was completely wrong... and I'm glad!This, magnificently written and wonderfully descriptive, is completely captivating and enthralling. King's use of italics, the inner thoughts of the character, really get you up real close and personal and deep inside. You can picture everything that's happening- you can feel it.The only thing I can criticise is a few minor editing errors, but apart from that I can find no other faults in this horrifying masterpiece; truly the King (pun intended) of all thrillers!Buy it. You won't be disappointed.
"
"
  The person who narrates this book is great, adds real voices to the story. The actual story is also great, a classic thriller horror from king. The audiobook really added to the text book for me.
"
"
  If I'm ever asked to name a book that can scare me, this is the one that comes first to mind. I'd seen the film first, yet somehow that didn't ruin the scares I got from reading this. I can fully understand why Joey in friends used to have to put the book in the freezer!
"
"
  Waited so long for no reason to read this. Couldn't put it down. So much more than the film. Excellent!
"
"
  I read this having seen the film and loved it.The core elements of the story ring true in both the film and book but they both exist in their own right.If you liked the film read the book.If you liked the book watch the film.You won't be disappointed with either one.
"
"
  I read this book a long time after watching the film and found it just as exciting. I was especially interested in finding out some of the puzzling questions raised by the film and enjoyed the conclusion more than the film's ending.. If you have read any of Stephen King's stories and enjoyed them, you won't be disappointed with this one.
"
"
  It's taken me a long time to get round to reading The Shining because I'd seen the film and didn't think I needed to. With other Stephen King films I've always read the book before seeing the film but I hadn't discovered Stephen King when this film came out.  The reason I decided to read it was Doctor Sleep, I read that and although it is an excellent story in its own right it inspired me to find out more about its prequel. I definitely recommend this book even if you've seen the film, the suspense builds and builds and you just won't be able to stop reading it. The author gives you the ability to read the minds of the characters, effectively giving you an insight into the fear they are experiencing and making your hair stand on end. You will believe that buildings have the power to control their inhabitants.
"
"
  Excellent book, great quality, speedy delivery. Couldn't ask for more!
"
"
  An effusive fan of his non-horror books and ‘The Stand’, I was very disappointed to be very disappointed by Stephen King’s ‘The Shining’. Grindingly predictable plot and thin characterisation left me bored, unmoved and not spooked in the least. 497 pages? It might have made a decent short story. I’ll forgive him, as I see it was only his third, published in 1977, but it may be a while before I try another.
"
"
  Seen the film at least twice but got so much more out of reading the book, well worthwhile.
"
"
  This book really is one of those classic books that you have to read in order to appreciate all of the underlying themes of family, friendship, alcoholism, fear and  tragedy. The shining is portrayed ally in popular culture and although I haven't seen the film, I've heard of it. This book amazed me  - it was powerful, beautifully descriptive and you found yourself in awe with the situation.
"
"
  The master has done it again. What can I say other than Stephen King is without doubt the best horror writer in the world. His ability to engage the reader is first class, you are drawn into the story immediately and you identify and relate with the characters which makes the story real and believable. A word of warning from someone who knows....when you sit down to read this, do yourself a favour and take the phone off the hook. One night I became so engrossed in the story, when the phone rang, my kindle was airborne!!! Nor was this the first time I read this book either. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good scare with every page.
"
"
  What a book! Flew through this. Every page kept you wanting more.
"
"
  I have seen the film.  I am enjoying reading about the characters it's a great story well written and hard to put down
"
"
  I downloaded this onto my Kindle because I know that I have Doctor Sleep in my Christmas stocking this year and I wanted to refresh my memory with the ""prequel"". The film was excellent but it just doesn't match up to the written word. This was one of the first Stephen King books I read as a teenager (early 40s now), along with Pet Sematary and Salem's Lot and it scared the beejeezus out of me. I've not finished this book yet (this time around) but I cannot describe the mixture of a wonderful sense of nostalgia combined with that discomfort that Mr King has the ability to impart. This is Stephen King at his disturbing best!
"
"
  gift for my daughter and she never put it down, quick delivery no complaints
"
"
  What can one say. Classic. I saw the movie years ago, so it does spoil it, however it's still a great read. Huge back stories as always. Stephen King at his best.
"
"
  Being a fan of the movie I was keen to read the sequel, 'Dr sleep'. However, I wasn't sure if it would contain references from the shining book (as it's slightly different from the movie) so decided to read this first. It's great. Just bloody great. Not swearing... Its contains lots of blood. Looking forward to getting on to the next book after this.
"
"
  Some parts of the book is very boring and dragging on.
"
"
  Loved reading the book. So different to the film. Love Stephen King!
"
"
  Now we in lockdown wanted granddaughter to read more
"
"
  If you thought the movie was good, try reading this!
"
"
  My sister loved it and it arrived very quickly. The inky problem is that it was battered up but that was probably in the post
"
"
  I just love this book and the whole Stephen King collection.
"
"
  I have always loved the film and never got round to reading the book, I'm glad I have now.I was shocked at how different the film was to the book, I know no film is ever as good as the book but I expected it to have more similarities.The shining will still always be one of my favourite films but I will also class this book to be one of my favourites to but fir very different reasons.
"
"
  I bought this book fir my son as he started reading it of the hospital library trolly. He told me it was a brilliant book. Obviously have seen the film but the book is something else. Christina Georgiou
"
"
  I am sure that the film put me off although I have never seen it, but I have read most of what Stephen King has written (bar a couple).When is new book Dr.Sleep came out I thought I had better read this so I could follow it through. WOWgreat read (bought the film now too, which I have never watched but now will do). The writing is so crisp and the characters do make you feel for them. Not sure about Jack though! I would recommend this book if you are a King fan and have not read it yet - where have we all been!
"
"
  I'm a huge Stephen King fan,but  have to be honest and say I prefer a lot of his earlier work.  I have the hard copy of The Shining as well and have read it so many times.  I love the book more than the film, it's Stephen King at his very, very best - the master of suspense, this is a real chiller.  Try reading this followed by Dr Sleep - Stephen King is simply the best.
"
"
  Being a fan of the film with the same title, I thought it about time to read the original story. I was not disappointed. This is my first Stephen King novel, and I thought the story, language and character build were fantastic. A story to make your heart beat faster (at moments). It was one of those rare stories that I struggle to put down.Differences between the original story and film are: story is longer, more time to develop characters and context, more I  depth in general. The film is very good in my opinion, but reading King' s novel is even better. Get it. Read it. Enjoy.
"
"
  Amazing book. The only down side is that it has tuned the film for me as that is a shell of a story compared to this. So much more detail about the relationship between Jack, Wendy and Danny. The Overlook Hotel is also like another character with its own personality. Ending also much better. Wish I had not waited so long to read this one.
"
"
  Loved this book, couldn’t put it down
"
"
  What a great book from a great writer, again drawn into his world of simply interesting characters who engage you probably due to Kings ability to make you feel you are in their minds. The book was all I wanted it to be and more as I enjoy my journey through his back catalogue of success from start to finish. The man's a genius.
"
"
  Great looking cover, Brilliant book
"
"
  Until now this book had been the only 'gap' in the Stephen King books I'd read. So when the sequel 'Dr. Sleep' came out I thought i'd go back and read 'The Shining' before going on to 'Dr. Sleep'. I'm glad I did! It's classic King! full of suspense, but with a slow build up before the brilliant climax! Magnificent! So much better than some of his later work.
"
"
  Never watched the film and was fed up of being the only person in the world not to have read this book. Stephen King is an amazing author and this book grips you from page one. Every line makes you want to read on until the very end and what a story. Fantastic.
"
"
  Came very well package and it had that lovely new book smell. I can’t wait to read this, it’s obviously going to be good considering that it’s been written by Stephen King himself.
"
"
  Exactly what was needed
"
"
  Absolutely fantastic.Such a good book.Add some music and it's magical.One of the best books I've read.
"
"
  Re-read this recently after having read and loved it as a teenager. Quite often that means one ends up a little disillusioned or disappointed and wonders what one's teenage self was seeing in a story - not so here, though. Still brilliant, still loved every bit of it, and still think it's one of his best.
"
"
  Fantastic book, definitely one of the best from Stephen King, far better than the film which is to be expected really, he’s notorious for hating the film adaption and after reading this I see why!
"
"
  In the middle of reading this book love Stephen king
"
"
  Great book,good service
"
"
  Having redeemed a gift voucher for my birthday I purchased the kindle edition of The Shining and also Doktor Sleep. Having read The Shining many years ago I did wonder if it would still have the same impact.............Most definitely YES!! Stephen King is a master craftsman and this book truly stands the test of time. Thoroughly recommend.
"
"
  Thank you
"
"
  Great thank you
"
"
  There has been so much talk about the novel ""The Shining"" recently that I thought I would read the book and see what all the fuss was about. I had seen the film many ears ago and whilst I thought it was OK I wasn't over impressed. The book was something different though and so much more enjoyable.
"
"
  Having read this book many years ago, I wanted to revisit before I go on to Dr Sleep.  very glad I did, I've found a better understanding of Jack Torrence and having took away the element of thinking of the film whilst reading as was the norm in my younger years, I found myself immersed in the characters, the hotel. the surroundings and the dark undertones of the book.  Extremely enjoyable. Mr King never disappoints.
"
"
  Decided to revisit this as I have bought the follow up book (Dr sleep) to read on holiday.Goodness me it reminded me that when I first read this I was ?living on my own and was so scared by this book !! Stephen King at his best , fabulous characters and descriptive writing that takes you right there - wonderful.
"
"
  Excellent Xmas gift
"
"
  I read this having watched the film multiple times in the past but my experience of the novel wasn't harmed by having expectations already set. Both the film and novel stand individually and their themes differ from one another. Truly one of the best horror novels I have ever read - a classic.
"
"
  I had not read this book for a long time and I had forget just how good it was. It gives so much depth to the characters (something that the film was unable to do) . The book is creepy and very claustrophobic and I love Stephen Kings early work but I'm now looking forward to reading Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  After watching the film The Shining many years ago, I read the sequel Doctor Sleep first, absolutely loved theory so much I almost wished I hadn't read it so I could read it again for the first time, so read the prequel The Shining, what an amazing book, and so different to the film, much better than the film, to the point you feel sorry for Jack, so here's to hoping that there will be a third in the series, but not such a long wait!!!!
"
"
  I re-read this novel in preparation for reading Dr Sleep, I'd forgotten how claustrophobic the hotel felt and how insidious the building fear is.  The fact that Jack isn't a bad man makes it all the more effective.  I agree with King that the film doesn't do justice to the book or its characters.  Loved it.
"
"
  I could have done without the hedge animals, I felt that some of the character reactions to situations hard to believe, and the ultimate confrontation was lacking, much like in the stand. That said, at one point I was so engrossed I nearly missed my stop, so it gets four stars.
"
"
  Best book I have ever read and will ever.  The characters are wonderful the love between. Wendy, Jack and their son Danny is heartbreak.  The frightening Overlook hotel changes their lives forever what an an amazing story. Stephen kings best ever novel and the best story ever written. Want to read it all over again. Cried when I had finished it
"
"
  I'd seen the film many years ago and loved it but the book is brilliantly written and I'd go as far as to say it's better than the film (like most books). It's definitely worth a read. It's the first Stephen King novel I've read and I'm so glad I did. I will now be reading alot more of his books.
"
"
  Brought the kindle version so I could re-read it prior to reading the new book that's just been released, as I hadn't read this book since I was a teenager.  I had forgotten what a great read this book is!  I enjoyed it much more than the movie, as there's so much more detail, and the book makes more sense.
"
"
  Hate the film but love the book! Got my imagination going and definitely scared myself a few times. Highly recommend this and the sequel doctor sleep
"
"
  Great book
"
"
  I reread this book in anticipation of the sequel coming out in Sept 13. I first read it in the early nineties when I was about twenty and loved it, the scariest book I had ever read at the time and literally had to put it down several times as I was so spooked. Second time around as a father the elements of child abuse add an extra layer of discomfort and I found this part of the novel the most disturbing.Stll a fabulous novel and with many extra layers than the sequel, which, if you read Kings foreward , he attempts to explain.
"
"
  I think this book (and film) have had more reviews than I've had hot dinners! Loved it first time round when it was first published,Second time round, after I saw the film, and now my copy of it is falling to bits from lending it to people, thought it time to get a new copy. One of King's best, and if you haven't already read it, you don't know what your missing, it's ten times better than the film andI' m re-reading it before I start ""Doctor Sleep"".
"
"
  This story is far more fleshed out in book-form than it was in the film. Also, I never knew there was a second part to the story. It's scary, gruesome. It's been so long since I read any of Stephen King's books that I forgot how frightening his stories were.I'm off to read book 2.
"
"
  My first Stephen King story and a real scare it was too.  The story and the formula were gripping and the suspense seldom let up. Must see the film now and read some more SK books.  I  think he's grossly underrated and it was a much better read than many of the more up to date suspense books I have read.
"
"
  Different to the famous film.  Better as you're imagination works at a deeper level in response to the book than when engaging with the film.  You can't help seeing Jack Nicholson to begin with, but he does tend to fade as you get deeper into the book.
"
"
  The book is far better that the excellent film. The plot builds slowly and the personalities are well drawn. Kings deftly plots the gradual descent into madness of Jack and unlike the film he does realise he is going mad. The hedge animals that come to life and the creepy play ground add an extra dimension to the book that are not in the film. The ending if better in the book than the film.
"
"
  A slow, boring read. Just couldn't get into it. Had it's moments but no where near as good as people made it out to be
"
"
  I thought i would read this first before the new book, and im so glad i did, i had remembered the film, which concentrates a lot on the main star jack nicholson , the book details what the shining is and gives a bigger picture  also its got different ending, I really enjoyed it now reading Dr Sleep Yay
"
"
  Yet another superb book from Stephen King. I re-read ""The Shining"" prior to this sequel which I got a lot more out of following a 35 year gap since I 1st read it. Although one would not at the end of ""The ""Shining"" expect a sequel it almost cried out for one. And what a story, pure, dead, brilliant.
"
"
  I don't think I have ever read a book that had my heart racing so quickly!! Outstanding writing, by the King of Horror. He just has a way of making the slightest thing truly terrifying. For the last 200 pages I could not put the book down. It will stay with you long after you have finished.
"
"
  Being a long term Stephen King fan, I went in expecting this to be the best book of his I would've read. I was wrong; it takes a long time to pick up (it's over halfway through before things truly get underway) but although the payoff is worth the wait, it's still far from his best. I wouldn't say it deserves a lot of the recognition it's been given, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a good read.
"
"
  Nice
"
"
  Well l love to read but l never could find my way into a Stephen king book's so after years and seeing and loving the shining many times l decide l would give the book a read as l find all movies made from books don't give all the good stuff and l have to say why did l wait so long .
"
"
  Did take me a while to read but it kept me gripped and now I can't wait to read the next one!
"
"
  First horror novel I've read and I thoroughly enjoyed it - in a scared-under-the-bedclothes sort of way!  The build up of tension was just masterly.Will certainly not be visiting any hotels out of season after reading this, but I will be buying more Stephen King novels!
"
"
  Really good book, I read in on my night shifts in a hotel (which was the worst possible idea by the way). Perhaps slightly unhappy with the ending, but there's some really really gripping chapters!

  Forget the movie. Once you read this Kubrick's movie will seem terrible to you. The book is much darker and many things happen in a totally different and better way. Stephen King himself disliked to movie for a reason! Read this book and you'll understand why King is the King of Horror novels.
"
"
  My first Stephen king book and it has me hooked to al his other works now. Amazing story telling and so much better than the film.
"
"
  I read THE SHINING years ago, but since I'm going through a ghost/horror phase after having been freaked out by Hill's WOMAN IN BLACK and Scott Mariani's creepy HOUSE OF MALICE which is also about a writer, I thought I'd revisit this book. I wasn't disappointed. It's great.
"
"
  AMAZING BOOK! Really wish I had read it sooner
"
"
  Great quality and quick delivery
"
"
  This is recommended for those that don't mind lerning the fantastic backstory Steven King gives his characters and plot. And after finishing the book you won't be disappointed in your purchase.
"
"
  Terrific story and brilliant narration. Really captures the mood!!
"
"
  Have bought the follow up book(Doctor Sleep)so wanted to re-acquaint myself with the background to it. The Shining is still a great read. Personally I prefer it to the film version as you can leave your imagination to run riot. Would recommend Doctor Sleep to anyone who liked The Shining.
"
"
  I reread The Shining recently after a number of years and it was even better!! Stephen KIng is amazing buildong up his characters and their relationships to each other.  You almost feel you know them!!  I still held my breath as I reached the end of the book!!  If you like suspence, imaginiative writing, real characters and a darn good story then read this book!
"
"
  A classic, but one I hadn't read. Very enjoyable, with brilliantly written and realised characters. The Overlook's menace was very chilling and I absolutely loved the whole thing
"
"
  Classic Stephen King. Bought for Xmas.
"
"
  amazed at how different the book is from the film, both great but now I have my own interpretation thanks to Stephen King's original story.
"
"
  Very thrilled with it.<U+0001F497>
"
"
  This book was excellent. Just the right thickness to prop up my wonky table in the dining room. Now Tiddles can come out to play again and i can put the first aid kit away.
"
"
  This story never gets old. A truly claustrophobic and frightening atmosphere pervades this book and I love it.I recommend this to anyone that is a fan of the horror genre.King knocks it out of the park time and again.
"
"
  The book had little tear on the front cover but otherwise it was okay.
"
"
  Came in perfect condition.Book itself it a good read
"
"
  His best book maybe
"
"
  I read this many years ago and have to admit it scared me more than any other book I'd read.  I've just downloaded it to my Kindle and look forward to re-reading it together with the sequel Doctor Sleep which I anticipate will be just as creepy.
"
"
  great book, but i found the start a bit boring. Overall a good book though, and would recommend to anyone who likes horror / thriller
"
"
  Great book. Well written and suspenseful. Takes a little while to get going, but when it does it really does.
"
"
  the worst truffle I've ever read.
"
"
  Well this was my first date with Stephen King, great read.The book was a gradual build up to the big bang, I was in two minds weather it was cabin fever or ghost of the Overlook hotel at work.I wouldn't say this book is scary, but it's gripping with suspense. Recommend it.
"
"
  Excellent story as are all Stephen king books
"
"
  King isn't the most sophisticated writer but this has such a good storyline, it's addictive. Genuinely terryfying
"
"
  Poor quality
"
"
  A great book,  I saw the movie first and thought that was awesome, and then I read the book, the book is brilliant far better than the movie, as with most of Stephen's work as the plots are psychological, it is difficult to translate to film.
"
"
  Took me a little while to get into this to be fair but stuck it out and now can't put it down
"
"
  A classic
"
"
  Although I bought this book many years ago, I had never got around to reading it, but decided to rectify this, when I was given the 'follow up' for Christmas!Stephen King at his best, brilliant story, sorry I never read it years ago.
"
"
  Stephen King at his awesome best. A tale that gripped from the start and did not let go until the last word. Every time you thought it must be over, it started again! Loved The Shining. Love Stephen King.
"
"
  You've gotta get a job looking after an old house and then do a few late nights while reading this book -
"
"
  The movie does not do this book justice, there is so much more to the ingredients of this story.the ending is completely different.I didn't like the part where the hotel tries to possess the cook. He should of remained the good guy as he has the shining like Danny and that is their connection. Loved the book can't wait to read  doctor sleep and see what Danny faces as an adult
"
"
  Just as good as I'd heard it was. Incredible story telling, felt like I was there at the overlook experiencing it with them.
"
"
  Good book
"
"
  As good as I thought it would be.
"
"
  As an avid lover of the film I couldn't wait to read the book. It differs a lot from the film but equally as thrilling - they both stand on their own as separate entities and shouldn't really be compared.
"
"
  Arrived quickly and as advertised.
"
"
  Great
"
"
  I'd heard a lot of good things about this book. But unfortunately feel Stephen king could have written it in fewer pages. The beginning grips you from the word go, and the ending is also well written. But the middle needs to be shortened. I felt 10 chapters could have been turned into 1.  GOING to read something else before reading the sequel. Dr sleep
"
"
  I avoided reading this book for 30 years because of the movie. That's my stupid loss! As my heading says. It's not the same story, it's better; I'll be back to read it again many times.
"
"
  I found this to be the creepiest of his books that ive read, really gets under your skin. King has a way of doing that.. his writing is perfectly creepy. So much better than the film (obviously!)
"
"
  grandsons favourite
"
"
  Another masterpiece from an amazing writer.Saw the film years ago without paying a lot of attention to it an decided to read the book because the sequel is out.Anyone who has read King before knows how good he is and this is up there with his best.I have read a lot of fantasy and horror including Dean Koontz and Richard Laymon and this is in the top three horror books i have read.
"
"
  Love this edition! Great book!
"
"
  thank you
"
"
  Great service, very fast. And what a read. I absolutely love stephen king and this is one of my favourites!!!!
"
"
  OK
"
"
  I have noticed that there have been typos in a number of the kindle books I have purchased, and I have purchased quite a few now.More attention to proof reading required please.
"
"
  A genuinely creepy and fantastic book-a but slow to start but once the first “unnatural” things occur it draws you in completely.
"
"
  No comment. Why do I need to fill this out when I have already rated the goods above? The rating should speak for itself. Would I buy some more? Yes. There, that should fill up the space.
"
"
  What a great writer.
"
"
  Was told this was one of his best, wanted to read it before I saw the film, loved the book, film not so much
"
"
  I have been a Stephen King fan for many years but had no real interest in reading this book as clips of the film when I was younger had put me off.  Very happy to report that, as is usually the case, the book is a lot better than the film!  I should have kept the faith Mr King, you rarely let me down
"
"
  King at his best, totally love this book and have read it a few times, just a little trip down memory lane before I start Doctor Sleep, it has a hard job to beat The Shining!
"
"
  After being a massive fan of the film, I decided it was time to read the book... Well, wasn't that a bad idea! The book itself is absolutely fantastic, however it's ruined my opinion of the film! Every person who is a big fan of the film should definitely read the book, so much more detail and back story.
"
"
  Different to the film. Good book
"
"
  Perfect
"
"
  I thought the story line was excellent, characters very nicely unravelled and nice building of tension towards the end of the story
"
"
  I'm a fan of Stephen King and this book didn't let me down. It's probably advantageous that I've never seen the film. I am now scared of hedge animals!
"
"
  Very good writing, sometimes challenging, definitely chilling but loved reading it nevertheless.I would recommend this to anyone, even those who don't like horror movies
"
"
  The film is a classic but films never can seem to portray the subtle nuances of Stephen King's characters.  I often avoid books when I have already seen the film but this has so much more in it than the film it can be read almost as extra information.  My only downside was that the end was a little cheesy but then at least you finish reading the book on a high.
"
"
  Came new, in good condition. Great book like many others from Stephen king.
"
"
  It's a joy to read such a well-crafted book with such interesting characters.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the ""supernatural aspect"" in the hotel is a little too much for me to overcome.
"
"
  Absolutely fantastic! I just love Stephen King, couldn't put my kindle down. Even though I have read it before and know what happens it's a book I will read over and over.
"
"
  A fantastically scary book. This isn't gory or violent. The fear and unease you feel is palpable. I just don't know how he does it. Not much happens yet you are scared silly. A brilliant book.
"
"
  It must be over 25 years since I last reread The Shining. Unlike most novels you remember fondly, for whatever reason, often when you revisit them you are disappointed, and often quite shocked how the years have taken away their magic.However with this work which I still would argue is not King's best, Iwas pleasantly surprised hoe fresh it was, and still had the power to shock as we  witness Jack's descent into madness.
"
"
  As good as it gets. Read if you want to know the real Shining; great as the movie is, Kubrick got it wrong.
"
"
  Brilliant book, as all King's are. I bought this as a gift for someone and they couldn't put it down........
"
"
  One of Stephen king's best. With many novels there are goodies and baddies with the characters cut and dried, but with his novel all the characters have good and bad points and one could have even have some sympathies for the main baddy. A fast moving novel that is really a page turner.
"
"
  Kings' writing style immediately captured my attention and drawn me into the book. I usually have a problem with finishing the preambles of novels as they aremost times lack the charisma to darwing readers into the book. What's different for shining is that I have effortlessly finished twelve chapters of preamble and the book still hasn't lost me. I guess that's why they call kings the you-know-who in horror literature.
"
"
  I think this is one of the best King books and always worth a re-read. The film - while it was a 'better' Stephen King film - didn't do the book justice. I don't think they ever do, to be honest. Just bought it for my Kindle and looking forward to it so if you like a cracking story, read this .....
"
"
  A good read, full of detail that the mangled film version misses. The film is good as it stands, but it is an adaptation at best, the story is changed slightly to make it more scary in an obvious way. As always, the book is so much better than the movie.
"
"
  Rereading this book after twenty years in preparation for doctor sleep, just as enjoyable now as the first time I read it. I'd recommend this book to all Stephen King lovers but he has, in my opinion, written other books I have found more enjoyable thus the four star rating, maybe doctor sleep will be one of them.Great read, enjoy.
"
"
  Got as a giftA classic book
"
"
  Product was as stated in excellent condition
"
"
  Second time I've read the book 10 years apart. I loved it just as much the second time around. Much better than the movie!
"
"
  Book arrived in perfect condition; if you’re into your character development, you’ll love this novel.
"
"
  Much more creepier than the film could ever be I watched the film before I read the book ,big mistake,it just does not do it justice .The hedge animals coming to life ,oh God,I couldn't sleep.
"
"
  Great novel
"
"
  Great book, thrilling and creepy, true horror, one king’s best works
"
"
  great
"
"
  Awesome book. Gripping start to finish.
"
"
  Brilliant read and so often happens is a thousand times better than the film . Stephen King always brings the characters to life and makes you want to keep on reading
"
"
  I didn't bother reading The Shining as I had seen the film... I bought the book after Stephen King mentioned that he was not entirely happy the way the film was made.  The atmosphere in the book is completely different to that of the film (in a good way).  I am only half way throught and I love it!  I should have read this book a long time ago.....
"
"
  This booked arrived like I picked it out of the store myself. I'm absolutely flying through it!
"
"
  Not one to be read in the dark!! Brilliant service as always.
"
"
  Great story which I am re-reading before its sequel comes out soon.The film was of course a huge success and has attained cult status thanks to Jack Nicholson but the actual story stands on its own. Great pace and plot. Hints at more.
"
"
  fantastic
"
"
  Maybe this was over hyped ,maybe I expected too much but either way I didn't really enjoy this.It became more of a book I had to force myself to read rather than a book I looked forward to reading, maybe it's just me
"
"
  I've re-read this so many times that I almost know it by heart. It's everything that I love about Stephen King books - ideas that are just on the creepy side of ridiculous, compelling characters and a continuous sense of unease.
"
"
  Product received, no issues
"
"
  As I wanted to read Dr Sleep, I thought I ought to re-read The Shining and I was well impressed at how good (but scary) the book was in spite of reading it a long time ago. Can't wait to read Dr Sleep!
"
"
  As a reader of many of Stephen Kings books including the Tower series. I was given shining 2 so had to purchase the shining to read first
"
"
  First read this about 15 years ago, saw the film, did not like it! Just bought Dr Sleep on Kindle, and decided to revisit the book, glad I did. Thanks Stephen King
"
"
  Not perhaps Stephen Kings best novels, or perhaps that should be, not my favourite of his novels. But I realised I needed to read it again before embarking on Doctor Sleep :)
"
"
  Brilliant read, had the hairs on my neck at end multiple times. If you want a gripping story this is it
"
"
  I read this because I couldn't remember reading it before and I remembered the film being awful. I'm happy to say that the book is excellently written and injects plenty of suspense where needed!
"
"
  Stephen King at his early best. This part of his career was filled with wonderful characters and situation, none more vibrant than this tale of a haunted hotel.
"
"
  Great
"
"
  This was purchased as a Birthday present for my husband. He is a big Stephen King fan but this book was one he hadn't read and as a sequel had been published I purchased this but he hasn't yet read it
"
"
  Bought for my mum.
"
"
  One of the best, most well-written books that I have ever read. Really enjoyed it, worth reading even if you've seen the film, there are quite a lot of differences!
"
"
  I purchased this book and it came on the date it was supposed to come on:) was in great condition and is such an amazing box for anyone to read! There are some freaky parts in there and I would definitely recommend this book to anyone! Definitely the best book I have ever read in my entire life:)
"
"
  I bought this book brand new and it arrived in bad condition and i’m really sad about it:(
"
"
  Speedy delivery.  Product as described.  Thank you :-)
"
"
  Love this. My favourite author.
"
"
  SO much better than the film.  Suggest anyone who has seen the film reads the book there is so much more in it.
"
"
  What can I say that hasn't been said before? Just read it and you'll love it.
"
"
  AMAZING STORY
"
"
  This is one of King's best stories. Check out the sequel, Dr Sleep, equally as thrilling. Great reading for those who enjoy supernatural stories.
"
"
  I have never considered the author before but now I am hooked.  I chose it because it was recommended to me and I was not disappointed.  I enjoyed every minute of it ! The literature is excellent so descriptive I was scared stiff towards the end,and I will be reading more now
"
"
  Steven king at his vest  have seen the film but until now had never read the boik  the book is muvh better than the film I have rwad the much awaired follow Dr Sleep now after reading The Shining I understand Daniel Torrance batter  brilliant from atart to finish
"
"
  Brilliant book . Typical King. .A proper page turner .Found it very hard to put down. Good storyline and fast moving tension
"
"
  A long long time since I've read this book, probably 25 years ago or more, but on rereading it I was enthralled,  have always been a massive fan of Stephen King, and this book has reminded me why I got hooked in the first place.
"
"
  I used to read loads of S. King when I was a sulky teenager in the 90's. Then I stopped for no reason and recently thought that if I picked it up again it wouldn't be the same...only teens read horror bo tooks..well King is not just that and it's definitely not dated, I will be reading more of it next!!!
"
"
  Had to read before getting the new Doctor Sleep as it has been a long time since I last saw the film and found this book better then I remember the film, (as is always the case). It has lost none of the fear factor even in this day and age.
"
"
  I'm so glad I read this book. I saw an interview with Stephen king who was talking of how different the film and characters were to the book, so, I read it in three days and it was well worth it. Such a well written book and I'm now going to read doctor sleep.I think I might go through all of Stephen king's back catalogue!
"
"
  Stephen King at his very best, this has got to be one of my all time favourites.
"
"
  Definitely worth a read. I read this then watched the film. Film is nothing like the book, the book is alot better.
"
"
  Great read, paints Jack in a different light to the film, but both brilliant in separate ways...
"
"
  heard good things about this story.
"
"
  Well it is little scary but nothing really make you jump or shock. It was very too long pages and I couldn't wait to see what happen at the end but love it though. I am glad that my friend told me to read this book.
"
"
  I read it many years ago and was as gripped and enthralled the second time as the first.  It had lost none of its power or impact for me over time. Now I have a Kindle I seem to buy little else but Stephen King books and have had to rename it my Kingdle.
"
"
  I picked this up (downloaded?) because although I enjoyed the movie, there seemed  to be massive holes or parts I just didn't follow.Well it didn't disappoint. The book was far more explanatory and it was much more evident what was happening to the characters. It's often the case, but this is so much better than the movie.
"
"
  Straight to the point - I couldn't put this book down! I took it on holiday and simply couldn't stop reading it and when I did I couldn't stop thinking about what was going to happen in the upcoming chapters. This is easily by far the best horror book I have ever read!
"
"
  Excellent.
"
"
  Pleasantly surprised, just want to keep reading! Haven't finished the book yet, but I'm loving it, would recommend to a friend.
"
"
  Read this book so many times and still it gives me the creeps. Love the part with the topiary animals.Cannot recomend this book enough
"
"
  love this book i have read it so many times its just the best way better than the film recommend this to anyone and everyone
"
"
  This book has the obvious main plot about the hotel but it also studies human connections and how experiences effect us. There is many fascinating concepts mentioned and the book remains unbelievably tense from start to finish. Nothing that terrifying actually happens but I was constantly afraid of what would come next.
"
"
  Not seen the film so was on the edge of my seat all the way through.  Couldn't wait to get to the end but didn't want it to finish
"
"
  I'm usually not one for horror books (anything scary in fact); however, through a friend's recommendation I choose to read the shining and wasn't disappointed. Don't get me wrong I still had to put it down sometimes when it got too frightening, but it was so well written; I couldn't put it down. It's a must read, your imagination will be running wild.
"
"
  I read this book as I wanted to read the sequel. I enjoyed it especially towards the second half to the end.
"
"
  Because of the awful film of the same name, I've resisted reading this book for over 20 years. Unfortunately I can't get the film out of my head and lose myself in the story, which is usually what Stephen King does for me. I can't blame the author and I'm sure it deserves another star...
"
"
  After downloading Dr Sleep, I realised , while I had seen the original film many times,  I  had never actually read The Shining.I can't believe what I missed!!!!! An absolute page turner.
"
"
  Not many books frighten me, but this one was so graphic, it chills running down my spine. A really good famous classic and so well written, I'll buy all the other books now.
"
"
  One of Kings greatest
"
"
  Reread this after about fifteen years or more ,still love it , the characters are well drawn especially Danny and Halloran and Mr Pullman
"
"
  Another stephen king oldie but way better to read than watching the film and the long awaited follow up dr sleep was well worth the wait
"
"
  Still up there with the best ,no special effects no camera tricks, read the book as it was intended and enjoy the master of suspence
"
"
  The film is one of my favourite movies.The book, is SO much better!
"
"
  I bought this for my son as I had read it years ago. He thoroughly enjoyed it.
"
"
  A shining example (sorry) of a great story teller. The film did not do justice to this story. I just hope doctor sleep is as good.
"
"
  i am reading at the moment and it isgood
"
"
  Fantastic book from one of the great writes of our time. Very engaging and haunting, read this book while travelling and made the (very long) journey pass by quickly.
"
"
  A great read as you would expect from Stephen King. Watch the film also as it is true to the book and Jack Nicholson is a real scary guy in the film.
"
"
  Good product
"
"
  I have always been a huge fan of Stephen king and have not read this book since I was 16,it is still an incredible story,the way he writes gets you lost in the characters needing to know how it turns out
"
"
  very happy thank you
"
"
  Good quality paperback
"
"
  Wow this is King at his best. Amazing and credible story line full of monsters and fantastic bloody characters. Stupendous!
"
"
  probably the best book I've ever read.really scary.I love the film but find the book Much better.lot more to the book  than the film
"
"
  This is a book which you can not put down. When you must, it is all one can think about, the way Stephen king has written about his characters, you genuinely care and fear for them. My heart would literally be thumping in my chest with every thump of the mallet. A truly terrifying and superb must read.
"
"
  First class read for any Stephen King fan and follow it up with the sequel Dr Sleep which continues the story
"
"
  I've seen the film a few times but the book is even better! There are some moments where I was scared out of my wits!
"
"
  I love everything by Stephen King not finished this yet but loving it. Have seen the movie and cant wait for the shining 2 to come out
"
"
  I had seen the film but the book is sooo much better!!  At times I felt too scared to read on! But I couldn't leave it unfinished!! A hauntingly brilliant story! As always, well done Mr King!!
"
"
  Great book
"
"
  A great film and a great book - I look forward to reading it again.
"
"
  Excellent book for all readers, fans of horror will particularly enjoy this book
"
"
  Good
"
"
  I have read Stephen king before and he is so much more than a horror writer and this book is no exception.  Wonderfully written, genuinely scary, a modern masterpiece.
"
"
  On time and as described
"
"
  One of the better (earlier) books, deeply creepy, more so than the film. One of the few that I have re-read.
"
"
  Rereading it after a 40 year gap. I think it's still one his best books.
"
"
  Brilliant book couldn't put it down,scared me half to death. Million times better than the film,highly recommended don't be alone though good luck
"
"
  Very good
"
"
  The first horror book I've read & the first Stephen King book also. Very enjoyable & easy to get into, will definitely try more of his work. Would highly recommend.
"
"
  From the Master of horror is the classic novel ""The Shinning"", for anyone with a love of horror and ghost stories and an expertly crafted written word or two, then this ones for you. If you loved the film.......the book is even better!.
"
"
  Good read
"
"
  Great book couldn't put it down
"
"
  Very good book.
"
"
  Needed to read it again as I had been given the follow up for my birthday
"
"
  A great stroy that is a really good read,  a top book and a great film,  well worth a buy.
"
"
  very good book good page turner.  will be buying the follow on book 'Dr sleep'
"
"
  Stephen King is one of the world's finest writers and although every book he produces is a masterpiece I very much doubt that he will ever top this one!
"
"
  Picked up a digital copy of the shining as a prelude to reading dr sleep, having read the hard back many many years ago was pleasantly surprised at how good this book still as, particularly after the ham fisted attempt at putting it on the big screen. Forget the "" it's jack "" film version, for true terror read this instead !
"
"
  I read this some years ago & as I was ordering the sequel thought I would read it again. Every bit as enjoyable second time around-couldn't put it down.
"
"
  This has been an eventful book and twists and turns found it amazing and I enjoyed it thoroughly and the ending was fantastic can't wait to read the doctor sleep to see what happens
"
"
  I've seen the film and TV adaption, but really wanted to find out what really happened. I'm so glad that I did! The book is so much better, I could hardly put it down. Gripping and thrilling, just my cup of tea.
"
"
  5*
"
"
  A great story well worth reading
"
"
  As described
"
"
  Always a lover of Stephen King's novels. This really is a thrilling read, would recommend!
"
"
  This gripped me right from the start. I liked all of it from start to finish. Im now reading Doctor sleep
"
"
  Never seen the film, but loved the book. Stephen King never fails in his depiction of the strange and paranormal.
"
"
  Loved this book and watched the film when I was a little way in.  Have to say the film was great but the book is better !
"
"
  Great book  enjoyed every second of it, but I would like to now how the overlook got to be so evil.  5stars from me, you should now go on to read doctor sleep great book to both keep you hooked
"
"
  Great read - I think a better ending than the film.

"
  It was so imaginative with a wonderful use of words. I really  want to see the film now and see if it's as good as the book.
"
"
  Good
"
"
  Still reading this book but its one of his best, loving every page.
"
"
  Very good
"
"
  good book, good quality.
"
"
  Gripping read from start to finish, I could not put the book down. First King book I've read and I now can't wait to read more of his works.The story is chilling but inviting, I felt real empathy for the characters. Looking forward to reading more about Danny in the follow up Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  scary book, better than the film
"
"
  saw the film, you need to read this book, 100% better than the film. One of the best books S.K as wrote.
"
"
  Great book, different to the film but in a good way. Can't wait to read the next book Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  To read
"
"
  One of the best Stephen King's book ever. Reading it over the Halloween season makes it even more scary than it is...
"
"
  This book has been my favourite for years! If you love mind bending horror of a nightmare quality, this is the book for you! No one can describe a scene quite like Stephen King.
"
"
  Had to re-read this in preparation for Dr. Sleep. I had forgotten how good a story Stephen King used to write.
"
"
  Great gripping read enhanced by the image of Jack Nicholson grinning insanely! Easy to read SK book...everyone should give it a go.
"
"
  Good.Gonna watch the film now, see if its as good,,probably won't be. Daddy's home !! (incidentally Torrance never says this in the book).
"
"
  Good
"
"
  good book
"
"
  A fantastic gripping story so glad I finally  got around to reading it. The film was good but I enjoyed the book more
"
"
  Read this years ago when it was first published. Lost my copy, so i have just bought a new one. Have just read the sequel ""Doctor Sleep"". Stephen King back to his best. Hence the reason for my purchase.My faith in Mr. King has been restored.
"
"
  Its ok, very well written, but I got a bit bored towards the end and didn't find it particularly scary.I probably wouldn't recommend it
"
"
  Fantastic book really gripping would recommend to anyone.  much better than the film it actually made me feel scared in places!
"
"
  yet to read
"
"
  This book book if definitely worse reading and different from the film, better i'd say. If they do a remake I hope they use part from the book from start to finish.
"
"
  Without doubt my favourite book of all time. A must read. If it gets too scary just put it in the freezer.
"
"
  Still one of Stephen King's greatest works. A thrilling read.
"
"
  i saw the film first and only read the book cos dr sleep came out and was the second part to the story, book fantastic better than the film
"
"
  Read this about 20 years ago, but hand`t realised how much I`d forgotten. As usual, much better than the film; did Stanley Kubrick completely forget about the boiler?!! A true horror classic.
"
"
  Good book delivered  on time
"
"
  excellent book, greater insight than the film, recommend reading
"
"
  This book is simply stunning. I have read all the major King novels and have enjoyed them all. But the imagery in the shining is so vivid it's genuinely unnerving.
"
"
  ok
"
"
  As always Stephen King is the master story teller
"
"
  Excellent
"
"
  Classic Stephen King.
"
"
  Good book, read already.
"
"
  A little absurd of course, but it carries you along to the tense conclusion. Better than the film, of course!
"
"
  A sad and frightening story, takes you to deep and dark places. The author takes you inside each characters head, so it feels like you know them, and you grow to care for them. A fantastic read.
"
"
  Better than the movie. ....smell the oranges! !!
"
"
  Incredible and exemplary book worth a read!
"
"
  Slow build up  to be sure, but well worth it in the end.
"
"
  brilliant
"
"
  Its taken me almost ten years to get round to finishing this book, i kept trying but kept loosing interest, but finally i made it! Now to read dr sleep and catch up with Danny!Read the book as the film is no where near, King was right not to like the end product!
"
"
  A favourite of mine. Read this so many times now.
"
"
  Would recommend
"
"
  Arrived in perfect condition, thank you!
"
"
  Not yet finished the book yet but enjoying the read. Re reading the book after many years. Stephen King very good author.
"
"
  This is a must read, the film just doesn't do it justice, the ending of the book is way better than the film! Give it a go.
"
"
  Great read
"
"
  Having seen the film a few times without ever reading the book, the background to the Torrance family in the novel is quite illuminating. I thought it important to understand their history prior to embarking on Doctor Sleep. Glad I did.
"
"
  A fantastic read - can't wait for the follow up.The suspense was awesome right up to the end of the book.
"
"
  Amazing book the the legend that is King. Couldn't put it down.
"
"
  I first read this over 30 years ago and bought it again as an introduction to Doctor Sleep.  Even better than I remember it!  Not just the way he builds the suspense, but his portrayal of the characters is just fantastic.  Can't wait to read Doctor Sleep
"
"
  Typical King style, detailed and meticulous. The concept of the story is very spooky, much more so than the book itself. A very enjoyable read and much better than the movie
"
"
  Never seen the film. But the book was great. I had lots of mental movies while reading. Was daft enough to read couple of chapters at night. Looking forward to Dr Sleep next.
"
"
  I read this many years ago and, having read it again, can honestly say it's still a great read - Stephen King at his best!
"
"
  kindle book
"
"
  First book i read wont be the last!
"
"
  I've never read any Stephen King before and didn't realise what good writer he is!  I wouldn't recommend reading it in an empty house though!
"
"
  great
"
"
  I read this book many years ago, but decided to read it again before reading Doctor Sleep. Still a good read
"
"
  Awesome
"
"
  Fantastic book. One of my top Stephen king books. Highly recommended. Definitely worth a read in my own opinion. Peace
"
"
  i re visited the shining prior to reading dr sleep and im so glad I did, its far far better than the film I remember and kept me entranced all the way through with the detail that I had forgotten , well worth another go
"
"
  This is such a fantastic book- I couldn't put it down. My all time favourite book. I don't know what I'm going to do now I've finished it! Absolutely recommend to anyone- especially Stephen king fans! Amazing!!!
"
"
  daughter loves this
"
"
  More intense than the film. Not finished the book yet but do far so good. Find this to be a scary and gripping read.
"
"
  I have been a big fan of Stephen King since I read this book years ago. It is still as gripping as it was then.
"
"
  Gripping from start to finish! Great character development. I could read it again and again.
"
"
  Absolutely brilliant book! Always loved the film but think I love the book even more! The characters are so well drawn that it allows you to understand more what happens to Jack! Highly recommended to everybody!
"
"
  Read The Shining  then go straight to the follow up Dr Sleep. Fantastic and I am not a usual reader of this genre
"
"
  Really enjoyed this book which was well written and I could not put it downWould definitely recommend this book
"
"
  Gripping, terrifying, relentless, absolutely fantastic.  Read it over a couple of nights, scared myself and couldn't get to sleep but totally absorbing page turner. Can't wait to start the sequel now.
"
"
  I have recently been brought doctor sleep and wanted to read this first, brilliant book. Much better than the film.
"
"
  Yet again another brilliant read. Stephen king doesn't let his readers down. The main characters deal with the mysterious spirits of an old hotel locked up for winter with no way out. Enjoy
"
"
  Scared me as much today as it did in 1978. I loved the film but the book is so much better again.Now on to part two!
"
"
  Better than the film
"
"
  I am only half way through but is very well written and I am already gripped with anticipation. I am sure part two will be on my kindle very soon.
"
"
  A great book. Better than the movie.
"
"
  A classic Stephen King novel that hasn't lost its magic since I first read it more than ten years back.  Excited to be starting the follow-up shortly.
"
"
  A great read which describes the process of supernaturally induced madness in a grippingly scary way-very effective and much better than the 2nd film version which tried to cover all the book's details
"
"
  Exactly as described thank you.
"
"
  I wanted to re read the Shining before reading Dr Sleep as I loved this first book and movie.Just great and now enjoying the 2nd book
"
"
  Never had a bad read from kings book this is very thrilling to read and the film doesn't do it any justice but that's the case on all films
"
"
  Stephen King is one of my all time favourite authors and once again his book was amazing. I much of prefer this to the film adaptation
"
"
  I have purposely avoided the film so that I could read the book first. It's a great book and had me all the way. Would recommend it to anyone
"
"
  Great read!
"
"
  Absolutely fantastic. I was gripped from the very beginning. A must read for all horror lovers. I can't wait to get hold of the new second book..
"
"
  even after all these years this is still one of the best horror stories ever written .If you have never read it do yourself a favour start tonight
"
"
  Extreemly helpful company following a slight misunderstanding.many thanks.
"
"
  Happy
"
"
  Great read
"
"
  A great book that I would recommend to everyone. It may take a while to get started, but once it gets going, its a spine chilling masterpiece.
"
"

"
"
  So much better than the film. Those hedge animals creep me out every time I read this.I go it back to it again and again
"
"
  Very chilling
"
"
  A gripping storey kept me on the edge of my seat. Couldn't put this book down.
"
"
  Fast delivery, item exactly as described. Very happy
"
"
  Great book and great film, and the follow up Doctor Sleep, even better, hope they make that into a film too!
"
"
  The descriptions are so intense they make you shiver. Make sure you don't read this book whilst home alone.  It is scary!
"
"
  another brilliant Stephen king novel. never fails to impress. you will be missing out of you don't give this book a chance! looking forward to the sequel.
"
"
  Fantastic story and plot. Very gripping.
"
"
  Recommended!
"
"
  Good with the goose-bumps!!
"
"
  This book kept me hooked from start to finish. If you have imagination it can scare you to wits end
"
"
  Compelling read from the start. Looking forward to reading the follow up. The book had the ability to raise the heart rate....Here's Johnny...
"
"
  I thought the film was good , but the book was even better!! This is now my fave King book!
"
"
  Try and forget the film, this book is so much better. The suspense Stephen King creates just makes you read on and on. Quite brilliant!!
"
"
  The book was a little slow to start off with, but it gets so much better, a great read, would recommend.
"
"
  thrilling scary makes you wonder what is out there.have.nt seen the film now I want too.  so unbelievable creepy.
"
"
  Love the film, love the book
"
"
  Just re-read this as a pre-cursor to Dr. Sleep. Had really forgotten how scary King can be. Love it for the horror and the fantastic story-telling.
"
"
  A good read - not like the film at all. The film scared me so much but the book gives so much more insight into the overlook hotel
"
"
  bit slow at times but it all comes together nicely and is well written, overall the storyline was very entertaining and original. a good winter read .
"
"
  This is a good, if not a tad overly long and slightly long winded book. Definitely not for children though. Overall a great piece of writing.
"
"
  Good read, couldn't put it down, bit of a boring ending though, but all in all worth it. Would recommend this book
"
"
  Absolutely brilliant! Much better than the film and believe me I'm a huge fan of the film. A must read! full of suspense and terror
"
"
  so well written - I loved the characters, such depth.  Wish I'd read the book originally and left the film alone.
"
"
  amazingly written with suspense... couldn't put it down from about half way through... Brilliant to curl up on holiday with
"
"
  Well worth reading. Don't be put off if you disliked the film - this is miles better. Can't wait to read the sequel.
"
"
  The book was intriguing. Different but never boring. I loved how he easily shifted  perspectives. How he placed th  thought within the sentences.
"
"
  Had me sitting on the edge of  my seat from start to finish. Would recommend this to everyone, fantastic book!
"
"
  Very good book, just taking a while to get into the story so far. Fantastic writer as always, very pleased with speeedy delivery as well.
"
"
  I had forgot how much I loved this book.... looking forward to Doctor Sleep now :-)He does create amazing stories
"
"
  I could not put this book down, it had me on the edge of my seat. Stephen king at his best!
"
"
  I read this years ago, and had forgotten just how good it was. I may avoid topiary for a while...
"
"
  Had me scared out of my wits. Far better than an already great film. I raced through it, even when I didn't want to know what happened.
"
"
  I enjoyed every page, it kept me spellbound. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a keen reader, like myself. Willem van Heerden
"
"
  I saw the film before reading the book.  Pleased it was different enough from the film so did enjoy it.
"
"
  Decided to read this before reading Dr sleep. Glad I did as its so much better than the movie in so many ways
"
"
  Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the new sequel. I only wish there were more hours in a day.
"
"
  Worth reading the back story on king's personal life around this time. A good horror to compare to the film.
"
"
  Loved this book, gripping from the first page to the last. A must read this is Stephen King at his best
"
"
  couldn't put it down
"
"
  I could not put it down. It felt like I was there watching the whole story in front of me.
"
"
  less well written than more recent books
"
"
  Not a bad book, however quite slow at some parts and hard to push through. Endng wasn't worth the push through.
"
"
  Stephen king at his best. I don't read many books but couldn't put this one down. The film is brilliant by Kubrick, but the book is every bit as good.
"
"
  Good read, first Steven king novel I've read but definitely won't be the last. Would recommend it, well worth a read
"
"
  Just finished re-reading the shining and It was just as good this time as the first time I read it years ago!
"
"
  King at his best. Terrifying and uplifting all at once - a fantastic book, Knocks the socks off Dr Sleep.
"
"
  As always, a brilliant book by Stephen King .
"
"
  Great book and great quality
"

  This is possibly one of the scariest books I have ever read!!! It tells the story of Jack Torrance,(an alcoholic on the wagon), and his small family which consists of his wife, Wendy, and his son, Danny. What he doesn't realise is that Danny has a gift, not a very nice one either!!! He can see things that others can't and can also see what the future brings.In order to further his abstination from drinking, Jack takes a job of caretaker in a hotel that closes it's doors over the winter. He and his family will become totally isolated from the outside world, and their only means of communication is a C.B. radio.Altough slightly daunted by this, Jack and Wendy pack up their belongings with a hope to improve their marriage and Jack's writing career.On arriving at the Overlook Hotel, they are greeted by an elderly man who, although they have no clue, also possesses the same, strange gift that Danny has.He takes them on a tour of the hotel and lets Danny know telepathically that he understands his gift, and should Danny need help, he has only to call him with his mind.He tells Danny that because he is special, he might see some strange and horrible things at the Overlook, but they are just pictures of the past and cannot harm him. He says that no matter what, Danny is to stay away from room 217.The Torrances are left alone to live out the winter. Almost immediately, strange things begin to happen. We see Jack becoming more and more distant from his wife and son, and also more and more irritated by their presence.There are some truly horrific things behind those closed doors, and also some that roam quite freely! I felt completely terrified by some of the things that happen, so much so that I admit to having a little trouble sleeping!!!One thing I know is, I will NEVER have a topiary in my garden!!!Read this book whether you are a fan of King or not. This is one of those books that should be read at least once in an avid reader's lifetime.Just remember, not everything you see and hear are real...but then again, some ARE and they should be avoided at all costs!!!
"

  Very good read

  excellent read

  If you've seen the film first (as I have), you are still in for a treat. You may have the image of Jack Nicholson playing the lead roll stuck in your head, but that really makes little difference, the book is so different to the film in most places (not so that you think the film sucks in comparison, they're both great in their own way) and you become so engrossed in this story, that it really does send shivers down your spine.  I'm not an easily scared person, but this book really did creep me out. King dives deeply into the mind of a man on the very brink of insantiy and explores the deepest depths of fear in such a way that I was on more than one occasion biting my nails nervously whilst reading. I loved it!  The film's great in it's own way, but this is the TRUE horror story, as well as answers all the parts in the film you might not of fully understood at first. Never overlook the past.
"
"
  I first read this novel over 20 years ago.  I was too young and innocent to appreciate that it was about much more than a haunted hotel.  It is in fact the story of a man struggling against, and losing to, his demons - the greatest of which is alcoholism. While the film presents the hotel as a metaphor for Jack Torrance's crumbling mind, with the supernatural element reserved for his son's telepathic gift, the book describes a hotel that is evil and riddled with maleficent presences of one kind and another.  The portrayal of a mental breakdown in a toxic environment is disturbing and enthralling.Another lengthy, satisfying, juicy read that is fresh and relevant today.
"
"
  I haven’t seen the film and I wanted to read the book as it’s hailed as being a brilliant horror novel. I expect people know the story by now, we follow the family of Jack Torrance who takes over as caretaker of the Overlook hotel for the winter, where only he and his family will stay as blizzards enclose the hotel. He has a small child, Danny, who has strange visions that seem to increase as they arrive and stay at the hotel.There are a few spooky scenes and there is a lot of suspense but, given all the great reviews. I was left a bit disappointed by the actual book. I think maybe I was expecting too much. A couple of times I found myself getting a bit bored and I almost wanted to skip forward. I did care about the family and I wanted to know how is ended but sometimes it was a bit of a struggle to carry on reading. Saying that, the ‘ghostly’ scenes are very well written and you can image them very clearly in your mind. I love Stephen King but, for me, this was not one of his best.
"
"
  To be honest I was expecting more from this, I read the sequel to this book called doctor sleep and loved it so I wanted to try the original one thinking it would be better, but, I was wrong, it takes a while to get going and not much happens in the first quarter of the book, and considering that Stephen king is supposed to be one of the best writers of horror, it wasn't too good and it certainly wasn't scary. I personally prefer it's sequal. The one thing about this book that I did like was the character development especially with Danny Torrance the young boy as he starts discovering his abilities and powers.
"
"
  Stephen King is a master of horror, especially from this great read. Better than the film, it's perfect for Halloween or King fans anywhere.
"
"
  The Shining, to me, has to be one of King's best books. I did find the book hard to get into at first because he takes his time to develop his characters. Which, isn't always a bad thing (i'm just too impatient). I did find that once I got past the first couple of chapters I was gripped and found it hard to put the book down. I didn't think I could ever be scared from a book. I was wrong. The atmosphere and tension was built up very well and there were times when I lost sleep to find out what happens. Worth the read and look forward to its sequel.
"
"
  I agree with a lot of other people on here that some parts of the book could have been shortened as there was sometimes too much description. However, the slow build up of tension and jack losing himself is done brilliantly and I liked learning a bit about Jacks past with drink and his father and also previous hotel guests. There is a lot more emphasis on the supernatural which there isn't much of in the film and I enjoyed that. I wasn't as scared as I thought I would be though, I would say there's only really a few chapters that really creeped me out but really, that is down to the person and what they find creepy. Sometimes, when tension is building and you start to get freaked out and you can't stop turning the pages then bam end of chapter and the next chapter is all about something completely different which diffuses the tension when I was just getting into it and wanted more, I guess this is what could make people want to carry on reading, which it did but I found it a bit frustrating. It was written really well, sometimes what jack was thinking made me smile even though he was angry and going crazy stephen king makes it quite relatable and the way jack tries to justify his murderous thoughts I found quite funny and creepy at the same time. I also enjoyed danny's thoughts because we don't see much of that in the film and the description of his visions were creepy. I think hype can ruin books and films for people and I think people should approach this with a completely fresh mind. Overall I am really glad I read the book I really enjoyed it
"
"
  I've been a fan of the film for many years now and it was only very recently that I read the book. It's brilliant! I loved getting the back story of the characters, finding out how it is that Jack goes crazy and also the original ending. I've got to say I was never much of a fan of Danny in the film, but the book character you really find yourself sympathising with, you also find out the full extent of his ""shine"". The film glossed over a lot of key points, which I felt the book really filled out and explained. So if you've seen the film read it! And if you've never seen the film, start with this first!Great book all round!
"
"
  I have watched the film of ""The Shining"" many times, but I've never read the book before. To me, the book wasn't as frightening (the film always gives me the shivers), but it was a great read, nonetheless. The characters and story develop in a different, subtler, way, which really works in a novel. As long as you read it with an open mind and try not to compare it to the film, it is fantastic. I'm looking forward to the sequel later this year.
"
"
  From the very start of this book you almost get the feeling something isn't right - it truely is a chilling read and, in my opinion, Stephen King, yet again, proved himself to be in the A-listers of writers.As for the order itself:It came with perfect quality and reached my house within 2 days. No pages were ripped, nor did it show any signs of being tampered with.I strongly recommend you buy your future DVD's, books, CD's, e.t.c from this website as every time I have purchased a product it has reached my house within the time given, with perfect quality and each was safely wrapped.
"
"
  Stephen King always delivers. So much better than the movie. Gripping from start to finish. A Big 5 STARS!  Looking forward to a sequal.
"
"
  I started reading this book because of the amount of fantastic reviews I read however it just didn't live up to my expectations and the five star reviews. I spent the first 50% of the book waiting for something, ANYTHING, to happen and wondering when it was going to get as good as the reviews said. The last 20-30% of the book was fast paced and I couldn't stop turning the pages compared to the first 70% which I found quite slow. I found myself flicking through pages, barely giving them a glance, wading through the vast amount of description giving which quite frankly wasn't needed. However, this hasn't put me off, I will be reading the sequel to find out how Danny gets on.
"
"
  Amazing book everyone who likes reading should add this to their list . . . . . . . .
"
"
  I can see why King objected so much to the Kubrick movie after having read the book - they tell two different stories.  At the core they're both the same basic story, but the focus put on the various elements is dramatically different.  Don't think if you've seen the film that you know all that the Shining has to offer.King is a master storyteller, and the Shining is no exception - he manages to create a genuinely, deeply unsettling book despite having only drafted out some rather shallow characters.  This bothered me for the first hundred or so books, until I realised that it wasn't Jack Torrence who was the main character at all - it was the Overlook.  Once you make that mental adjustment, you get to see just how well realised the book's key participant is.  The other characters, largely just stereotypical sketches, exist only in contrast to the whims and wishes of the hotel.  Jack's struggle with alcoholism and violence is really his battle with the creeping, sinister presence of the mysterious hotel 'management'.  It's not really a story driven book - it's a character exploration, where the character is the accretion of historical horror within the splendour of its grand and faded architecture.It's not a perfect book, partially due to its unusual protagonist - we are left with a lot unresolved as the events reach their final conclusion, and I would have liked to have gotten more of the context of the spirits who were trapped within.  Jack's story feels dully predictable.  Danny is as interesting, I guess, as a five year old can be.  Wendy is the least developed of all the characters.  And yet, so much of the focus of the book is on their experiences, and so little on what it is that makes the Overlook what it is.Still, a thoroughly creepy read and well worth your time.
"
"
  This books first few chapters started really well but when I got 40% into the book I really really started ton struggled with it and found my self thinking should I really stop reading  this book. My personal opinion is that the book could of easily been half as long as it currently is because I found it very very slow going with long winded descriptions that last longer than it should have done.It also over describes small miner details that didn't need describing.I also found some bits far fetched especially the bush incident (I won't go into details in case someone's currently reading) which ruined my ability to be drawn into the book.I found the book more funny that scary for some unknown reason. Very poorly written with a lack of story and plot.In all honesty I don't see what all the fuss is about this book I certainly won't be re reading it any time soon. Please do not let my negative review put you off reading this book we all have our own opinions and this is mine
"
"
  Having read this as a teenager borrowing the book from a friend I was keen to re-read. Must admit I was a little disappointed. typical Stephen King but not his best.
"
"
  My favourite King book! The skillfully managed narratives of such different characters and the daunting threat of such great proportions makes this a must read. I didn't want to put it down and i didn't realise i could be frightened of playgrounds.
"
"
  I read this book, years ago, whilst in my teens, and I remember enjoying it, but not to the extent where I ever thought I would pick it up again. However, the years have passed, and coming across the book on offer at a local book store, whilst looking for my next read, I thought I'd give it another go. I remembered the premise (most will know of it already from the movie) and a few random details (Jack crunching Aspirin in a phone booth has always stayed with me for some reason!), but, as is the case with time, most of the book was forgotten.On second reading, I flew through it, and wanted to start it again upon completion. It is now one of my favourite books, and easily my favourite King books (I've not read them all though, maybe 10 or 12 tops).The main difference from the movie, for those who have seen it, was, not an event in the book, but the way in which the characters were portrayed. For me, Jack was not the villain; without wanting to go into ""spoiler"" territory, Jack is a more empathetic character, struggling with guilt and addiction, as well of constantly struggling to re-earn the trust of Wendy (his wife/Danny's mother) following events laid out in the book. Wendy herself, is not quite the pleasant quiet character from the movie. Wendy is very untrusting, quite judgemental, and resentful, not just of Jack, but of the relationship between Jack and Danny. In short the characters in the book are far more human, and it makes for a very compelling read, being able to relate, on occasion, to all of the main characters within.Some of King's works are on a grand scale, and can feature tens (if not hundreds) of characters, but for me, his best works feature a smaller cast, building on a few characters, allowing the reader to develop more of an attachment to everyone in the book. If you've never read a Stephen King book, I highly recommend this as a place to start, it is gripping, tense, funny, scary and emotional all in one.

  So much better than a movie. You have to give in, it is just fantastic! Get a copy for yourself now!

  I am a big fan of SK but had previously never read this book because I had seen the film a long time ago.  However, with the new SK book coming using some of the charcters from this book, I thought I should do some background reading! I am glad that I did!

  One of the best horror stories ever written by the finest writer of the genre. Have and will continue to read it again and again, knowing that each time it will deliver an incredibly creepy experience.

  This is one of the most difficult reviews I've had to write. But before I go into that, a spooky story happened to me just after I started writing this book. For some reason, at about page 80, I stalled on reading the book because I was too busy at work and I wasn't really enjoying it. I went away on business for a night and stayed in a suite at the Marriott Swindon hotel and on arriving at the suite, there was a strong smell of antiseptic/Germolene in the bedroom which, upon thorough investigation, the hotel manager could not locate the source or provide and explanation for the very pungent smell. So I climbed into bed and picked up The Shining to read before going to sleep. And on page 86, it mentioned the horrible things happening in room 217. So you can imagine my horror the next morning when I checked out of the hotel that the receptionist handed me a copy of my bill with the Suite's name printed next to the room number - 217!! Aaaarrrrggghhh......Anyway, back to the review, I desperately wanted to enjoy this book for several reasons:1. It's a Stephen King book so it's bound to be good2. I've always wanted to read a Stephen King book and this one is one of his most famous3. I really enjoyed his book 'On Writing' so I thought I would learn a lot about how to write a novelSo where to start?Well from a structural perspective, this book hits all the beats of a horror/thriller novel - a 'monster', an enclosed space, vulnerable characters, threat of death. I enjoyed analysing the beats and doing a post-mortem on the set-up and payoffs, foreshadowing etc. If I was to rate the book on this quality alone, it would be 5/5.The characters of Wendy and Danny were enjoyable to read and I rooted for them both from start to finish. Even Jack - I wanted him to overcome his inner demons once and for all so he could be the man he desperately wanted to be. I now want to read Danny's continued story in Doctor Sleep and on my list for the 2016 reading challenge.Pace - I found it terribly slow at the start and really until about 80% of the way into the book. It lacked real tension until this point and some of the descriptions were too long and prolonged the telling of the story. That said, some of the descriptions were fantastic - very graphic and sensory and I learned a lot about descriptive writing from those paragraphs.Tension - there was a hint of terrible things lurking round corners throughout the book but it was only in the last 20% of the novel that the tension built to pressure cooker level. I really enjoyed the last 100 pages. But I only got to that point by sheer perseverance and the determination not to give up on a Stephen King book.I feel like I've been a bit harsh with my 3 star rating but it does reflect the points above and my overall enjoyment of the novel.

  Okay, so I was looking for a great horror I could sink my teeth into...I did!! I thought it was an excellent read! Stephen King really knows how to make your mind play tricks on you! If you are considering to read it...DO, you wont be disappointed!
"
"
  I've read this time and time again. Any King fan or fan of books in general will live this book. Read it in time for the much anticipated sequel in Sept 13.

  The Shining is one of Stephen King's most famous novels, so many new to King may automatically plump for this one. There's little doubt in my mind that this story brilliantly weaves the paranormal and psychic abilities of young Danny, who has the 'shining' ability of the title with the real issues of a marriage that on the surface appears to be okay, but there is a bubbling undercurrent about what Wendy really thinks of John 'Jack' Torrance.As so many have reviewed this book already, I will mention what you already know - Stanley Kubrick's film is probably far more famous. As an iconic horror, there are fewer scarier films out there than The Shining.Kubrick took elements of the book and made them huge in the film. So whether you read the book first, or have seen the film first, I think you can appreciate them both for what they are.I think the character in the book is slightly more sympathetic, but I lost patience with Jack the more he seemed to chance his arm, thumbing his nose at current employers (and I mean Ullmann and Shockley, not the 'employers' at the Overlook as implied in the book's final third).To really enjoy this book, one almost has to forget about the film. Having said all that, this is not one of Stephen King's greatest novels. It is an intriguing work and set the ground for (in my view) even better novels such as The Dark Half, Misery, Desperation, and my personal favourite - Pet Semetary.The book could have done with a trim, but I really do enjoy King's word creation, complex characters, and genius storytelling. There's a reason why Stephen King is viewed as one of the world's greatest ever writers, and The Shining is choc full of them. It says a lot that it is not perfect in my view only because I know he has done better. But on its own, it is a brilliant story, and re-reading this two years or so after I read the sequel, Doctor Sleep, I appreciate it all the more.

  That was one of the few times that the differences between the book and the movie did not bother me at all. In spite of the quality of the movie, which I loved as well, the book is still pretty intense. I just couldn't get my eyes out of the book. This is simply one of the best books I've read so far! Congrats Mr. King!!
"
"
  First Stephen king book I've read, and I am going to read another straight after this, I couldn't put it down, great story scary, freaky, spooky, just like the 'overlook' pulls you in so does this book.
"
"
  I really like the way Stephen King invites the supernatural element, both good and evil, to a seemingly real world. Also, the entwining of historical events within the hotel helped spark my imagination's captivation. It was such an easy read. Would recommend this to readers who are interested in the thriller/horror genre.
"
"
  So much better than the film, far more subtle, clever and thought through.  First King I read, and will now read more
"
"
  I was overwhelmed by this. King does supernatural/paranormal so convincingly. In the fabulous snowed-in setting of the Colorado mountains we see a man (Jack Torrance) fall apart in a hotel full of ghosts. While we start out rooting for him, we gradually lose sympathy as he becomes increasingly deranged. The characters are brilliantly drawn, particularly Jack's son Danny, who has psychic powers. I am looking forward to reading the new sequel.
"
"
  This is so well written, I was completely lost in the story. I would recommend this to anyone whether they like horror or not!
"
"
  Good read.Having seen the film I wanted to read the book.I think I prefer the film. I should have read the book first.
"
"
  What can be said about this book, apart from a must read. It's gets in your mind long after it puts down. It won't let you go just like the Overlook Hotel.
"
"
  I would stay up until the early hours and read whenever possible as i simply had to know what would happen to these wretched characters. Stephen King at his best.
"
"
  Absolutely loved this book.  100% better than the brilliant film adaptation, with a lot more explanations behind the characters actions.  I would recommend this novel to those who are not normally King fans
"
"
  I've been a huge King fan since I was a teenager, I've read the majority of his books and he never disappointed me. However, because I saw the film a few times, I had never read The Shining believing it would be the same as the movie. Now I just finished it, and I have to say its way better than Kubrick's motion picture. Its probably one of King's finest, along with It and The Stand. Beautifully written, scarier than any other book I've ever read, thrilling, addictive, a wonderful masterpiece, probably the best horror novel of the past century. I feel ashamed I didn't open it before. From now on, hedge animals, mallets and bathroom tubs won't be the same to me... He transports you into a nightmare and forces you to open the eyes and see... If I could give it ten stars instead of five I would. If you haven't read it yet, even if you are not a King fan, you should. And enjoy a brilliant and mesmerising book
"
"
  Tedious and boring. I've battled through most of it, but I'm not sure if I can be bothered to finish it. Nothing happens for most of the time. The characters are annoying. The parents are awful. The five year old son talks like a grown up. Maybe I'm alone in not finding a fire hose and a hedge especially scary. A complete waste of time.
"
"
  Now the sequel is out, I just had to remind myself...only to be confused with the movie.was waiting for here's johnny, witch never materialized in the book.but it was good to reminisce.
"
"
  Another classic Stephen king book that I am very glad I have taken time out of my life to read. It had suspense, tension and everything else you want in a book
"
"
  Hi folks,If you are going to purchase this book, then be sure to buy THIS (Hodder) publication and not the one by: Anchor.This is because the latter-mentioned is small, flimsy and of very poor quality.  I had to return mine to the seller (for a refund) and purchase this superior version instead.Hope this helps . . .Best,Paul David Seaman (UK)
"
"
  I have read this book several times and invariably find something new and interesting. NEVER go see the film [which is dreadful].
"
"
  This was different to the film. However the book was better than the film, therefore I was pleased about that.
"
"
  Still reading this book it's very good although I love the film this is actually a lot more detailed looking forward to the rest....
"
"
  Bought this to read with my great nephew, it was holiday reading fo english lit. I would not have kept going if it was for my pleasure. I finished so I could discuss the novel with my great nephew. I found the characters unrealistic, the boy spoke and thought in a way much older than his years. I know others love SK and so this is a personal view.
"
"
  The film really did not do this book justice. It's well paced and a good mix of terror with apathy, menacing until the last and responsible for a few nightmares.Well worth reading.
"
"
  Quite a slow start but once you get into it its really good!! Not very scary though but a great read!!
"
"
  The book is fine, but some of the pages were folded.
"
"
  Good
"
"
  I read through most of what was yet printed of Stephen King back in my teens, but for some reason never got round to this.  Maybe it was the pictures of the movie in my head that made me uninterested.  Whatever the reason, it was my loss.  In a fit of curiosity I downloaded it to my kindle and spent a few days pleasantly snowed in at the Outlook.It's one more reminder of, even back then, what an incredible writer Stephen King is.  He excels in creating character.  And when you consider what we now know of his struggles with alcohol, it's an intriguing read on many levels.  On top of that, anyone who can make hedge animals seem sinister must have something going for him.
"
"
  I read this twice as a teenager and really liked it then. Coming back 20 years later I wasn't expecting it to be great literature, but I was surprised at how badly it stood up to re-reading.As is common with King's work, it would be improved by being edited down to at least half the length. It's also let down by too much unilluminating detail in the (often unnecessary) back stories of the characters.There is a good story in there. But its obscured by clumsy writing, painfully bad excursions into cod psychology and philosophy and a tendency to ramble on off-subject at the expense of moving the story forwards.
"
"
  This is one of my favourite Stephen King novels. It has genuine scary moments in it and surrealism. There's also a detailed and painful portrayal of Jack Torrance being slowly taken over by the hotel ghosts/spirits.
"
"
  Just amazing. After reading so much SK I finally got around to this! Thought the film would have spoiled it for me, so so wrong!!!
"
"
  So scarey!
"
"
  Excellent.
"

  Bought for my son to read he said it was very hard to get into. Had to read it for school

  -The photo is advertising the Steven King The Shining this particular book though is published by Book Club Associates not what the description below is advertising which is New English Library (Hodder & Stoughton - who bought New English Library).-They also say in description that the book is First edition (1 Jan. 1989) what they have sent me is Third Impression.-The only thing they got right was they sent the New English Library (Hodder & Stoughton) edition which is part of the description.-As you can see by picture below its the same title different cover. If you collect the different covers its not what is being shown in the photo they are selling.-Plus also if you buy the American edition its in English but American English so its written differently. Same with any other country edition apart from the many UK versions they are written differently to suit the language. Plus also have their own covers as well.-Plus also it does not say if this one that they are selling is a small hardback, medium hardback or full size hardback. Shown in my second photo (just do not own a copy in medium hardback of Insommia).-So if your a fanatic about your books it does not give enough description and is false impression by its photo.

  I remember once considering the difference between ‘terror’ and ‘horror’. I think my conclusion was that ‘terror’ concerns a build up of events. That creaking floorboard, eerie silence, and the thought of being watched – they all make up what I’d define as ‘terror’, whilst the physical act of suspense being broken would be called ‘horror’; when a drunken man attacks his wife and a dead woman rises up from a bathtub, wrapping her clammy hands around a small boy’s neck, that’s ‘horror’. The Shining offers us both, and does so pretty superbly. For most of the novel, we have the ‘terror’ drawing us in and creating what feels like a very real fear of the Overlook Hotel. Then it’s within these last one hundred pages that you really start to see the ‘horror’ coming out.It’s honestly one of the best novels I have ever read. That’s all I can say and, really, all that I need to say. If you haven’t read it, and it even slightly appeals to you, I urge you to go and get yourself a copy; I promise you, you will not be disappointed.

  Having just finished Silence of the Lambs and being amazed at the sheer intelligence of Thomas Harris', I thought I'd finish another novel which has been made into an incredible film. I therefore continued reading The Shining, which I had started 6 months ago.However, The Shining did not give me the same amazement I'm afraid, and I actually think this falls into a new category for me where unfortunately the film is better than the book, normally I am a great believer in the book being infinitely better than the film that it spawned.This just felt fleshed out with unnecessary content which for me did not add enough to the story to warrant the hours of my time. Whereas Silence of the Lambs stayed true to the book, this is somewhat different from the film and for me it is worse for it.It of course is still a good read as the thousands of reviews can vouch for... But if you've seen the film, just leave it at that.

  As a long time Stephen King fan, I am ashamed to say that until around two weeks ago I had not read “The Shining”, I think the main reason for this is that I made the mistake of watching the film. The film is very different from the book, as is usually the case; I seem to remember reading in an article that SK had an argument with Stanley Kubrick during the making of this film, which is not surprising due to the awful film that was made.The Shining is not a book that can classed as light reading, you need to have plenty of time to follow it and let the creepiness of it sink in and imagine what you would do in the circumstances that Danny Torrance finds himself, and how little choice he had in anything that happened before, during and after the events of the Overlook hotel and what his relationship was like with his father, who was mentally and physically consumed by the hotel.Bearing all this in mind, the shining is a slow burner in the early stages of the book and I can see why some people may have abandoned this book as a result, but my advice is to stick with it, it gets very good and very creepy, although the hedge animals were ridiculous they did lend to the story that the three people at the overlook hotel were not alone and really were in constant threat of being picked off by spirits of the hotel and the creepiness they felt when they were alone (you do have to question why they keep letting a four year old wonder off by himself when it is clearly not a good idea).I am steadily working my way through all of SK’s books and have been for a few years now, it is hard to believe SK was only in his late 20’s to early 30’s when he wrote this book, the scene, the characters and the strengths and weaknesses and how they develop into more is classic King, character development I would argue is possibly his best writing skill; he often has characters who seem to be nothing but develop into warriors.I rated this book a 4 star as it is a great read, but probably not for everyone.

  Mr President, I have met the martians and am pleased to report they are friendly'.I went into this with no idea what it was about, although I've seen the iconic crazy eyes image from the film I've never watched it. And wow, just wow.'He was like a man who had leaned around a corner and had seen an unexpected monster lying in wait, crouching among the dried bones of its old kills'This was a real reading experience for me, the whole book is so dark, atmospheric and creepy that awake or sleep this book was on my mind which is a total high five to an author when their book consumes you in that way. It will be a long time before I admire topiary again that's for sure.The characters were so fleshed out, the location was brought to life on the pages and the actual plot was perfectly paced.Having read books on both the Donner Party and Stigmata in the last few years I enjoyed the references in The Shining.Five stars with the potential to be knocked down if the nightmares dont stop!A great start to my 2020 reading.

  This review of the book is based on reading after seeing the masterful Kubrick film. You know the phrase ""less is more"", this is never more true than for Horror. When we see the monster at the end it is usually a disappointment because it is not as scary as your imagination of what it could look like. This is the problem with the novel. Stephen King kills all sense of tension, or horror, from over explaining everything. While Kubrick left us to our imagination as to why things are happening as the plot unfolds King leaves little that is not explained. All the murders and ghosts have been given back history so by the time they turn up any sense of horror has been sapped.Case in point - in the film we are told that the Overlook was built on a Red Indian burial ground. That is it - one sentence spoken by Mr. Ullman (the manager) in a throw away remark. We, the viewer, can fill in the blanks. In the novel we get page after page after page of back history that leaves literally nothing left to us to think about. It is as if King did not know when to stop.The book is at least a third too long and it needed a different editor to reign a lot of it back in. The length is due to the many deviations from the plot to build character, but a lot of it is totally unnecessary. So many pages was written about Jack Torrence (one of the main protagonist) fight against his alcoholism. A lot of the description was totally unnecessary and had no bearing on what happens in the hotel. When over 50 pages is about unnecessary back story - you cannot help but care less. All the characters seem do in the novel is talk - towards the end I was not surprised the ghosts turned up just so they can kick these people out of the hotel to get some ear rest.Additionally some characters just did not feel right, for example Tony (the imaginary friend of Danny Torrance) was ridiculous, and unlike in Kubrick's version whom we never actually see, again making him mysterious and scary, he comes across as silly in the book - a floating 12 year old kid. No.King does deserve a lot of credit for the story, the setting, the idea of the Shining and the family Torrance and Dick Hallorann, but sad to say, it took the genius Kubrick to give us The Shining, the horror story that is just as scary and just as famous today as it was over 30 years ago.If you have not read the book, save yourself the bother, and watch the film instead.If you want a video review of how bad the book is compared to the film - just watch the nostalgia critic (it is hilarious)[...]

  ""Danny is a 'shiner', aglow with psychic voltage.When his father becomes caretaker of the Overlook Hotel his visions grow frighteningly out of control.There is an evil force in the hotel- and it too is beginning to shine...""The Shining is a horror classic. Is that stating the obvious? Yes. Is it redundant? No. It deserves to be repeated over and over, with emphatic excitement, because the spectacular supernatural story that this novel contains is a force to be reckoned with. Haunting horror surrounds and merges with captivating character progressions, ensuring that, by that final page, even the most critically minded will be unable to deny The Shining's revered status.I just can't beat the book from my mind (not that I'm trying particularly hard; although, when it's time for sleep that might change). The depth of the novel's themes and its passionate dissection of the human psyche elevates everything past just simple horror. A lot of this is due to insane imagination, but the personal turmoils of the author are undeniably present and palpable.The Shining has a sliver of King's soul, and it shines with devastating delight.SynopsisDanny is only five years old but in the words of Mr Hallorann he is a 'shiner', aglow with psychic voltage. When his father becomes caretaker of the Overlook Hotel his visions grow frighteningly out of control. Who is the woman in Room 217? And why do the hedges shaped like animals seem so alive? There is an evil force in the hotel - and it too is beginning to shine...Plot - 5/5 StarsSet in the Overlook Hotel, an extravagant vista nestled in the mountains of Colorado, The Shining drenches itself in realism right from the get-go. King has a way with tone and atmosphere that, no matter how supernatural the story gets, keeps the reader grounded and terrified. Caught up in the events of the plot you'd be forgiven for jumping at the slightest sound (and, yes, this feeling continues even when you set the novel down).I love the way the terror builds, with little quirks and habits collecting to form a picture that, once you see its scope and ramifications, you realise time has run out and it's too bloody late.But The Shining isn't exclusively horror. It's not even exclusively supernatural. Instead, King weaves a tight tale about many different themes and trials. We follow a family on the rocks, each of them fighting metaphoric demons along with the real ones: Isolation, alcoholism, love, hope, doubt, hate, and on and on it goes. Each trait this novel possesses is tuned to perfection, creating a kaleidoscope of colours that stuns you with their sharpness.The plot at the core, however, stands as strong as the supports that surround it. Insightful questions are answered with genuine answers, and King sprinkles some breadcrumbs to make sure the reader is never far off from the loop.Pace - 4.5/5 StarsNormally I'm a reader who enjoys a faster pace, usually with the help of some mindless action, but The Shining offers a measured and contemplative experience. It has things it wants to say and scares it works the hell out of. But what I think bypasses my predilection for zoom, zoom, zoom, is the fascinating myriad of stories. This novel is never uneventful, and with King's mastery over every aspect of information in his worlds, nothing you're given ever feels like 'filler'.Plus, when the oddities go from unnerving to terrifying, the slow, bubbling pace adds nerve-wracking tension with a gloved haymaker.Characters - 5/5 StarsPersonalities, histories, motivations... Everything that goes into making a character is exceptional. King's ability to unfurl and study an individual's human nature with accuracy and passion is unparalleled. Infused with personal experiences of his own, The Shining comes alive.Realistic family drama provides a sense of normalcy that is balanced with the supernatural hauntings, raising the games of both. King's cast is diverse and so well created that even the most despicable is hard to judge. The shades of grey enhance situations. Actions have consequences, nature vs nurture vs both is explored, and the sense of chaos is unstoppable as the characters all fight for control.Writing - 5/5 StarsStephen King.That's really all this section needs - the author's name. The Shining wouldn't have been able to cement itself in literature in the way it has without King's talent and tenacity. Everything I wrote above is testament to just how well he can spin a phrase and build a story. Scenes stick with you and experiences are heartfelt.With so much going on within the story, The Shining is without a doubt an intense ride, but it's also one you can go back to. I sincerely plan on rereading the book again in the future and I'm positive there will be new aspects of it for me to find.Overall - 5/5 StarsI'm late to this party, I know, but better late than never. If you're like me and for some reason you haven't read this book, get going now! The Shining is the gold standard when it comes to supernatural horror, and its character studies are a phenomenal treat.

  ""Obviously a masterpiece, probably the best supernatural novel in a hundred years"" - Peter Straub.The quote from Peter Straub says it all! It is definitely the best supernatural novel I have read so far.Having already seen the film to this I automatically thought that I would know what would happen next and how the book would end.I was wrong.The story had me guessing at evey corner and I could not put it down. The tension in the story was maintained throughout the majority of the book which is a hard skill to master, and proves that King is a master.If you have already watched The Shining and don't want to read the book because of that reason. I recommend that you pick it up anyway becuase it is very different, and much more enjoyable.Overall 5* - Recommend to everyone who is a fan of fiction and horror!

  In Stephen King’s The Shining (1977) Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy and their five-year-old son Danny relocate to the Overlook Hotel in the Colorado mountains because Jack has been offered a position as the hotel’s winter caretaker. The hotel closes until spring and the Torrances are all alone. This role is Jack’s last chance. He’s messed every other job up, due to his alcoholism. The family hope this will bring them together, allow Jack to finish his play, and earn some well needed stability. But Jack’s boozy past is like a long shadow, following him everywhere. Can the family hold on to their sanity in that creaking old hotel?King’s third novel is a fan’s favourite, it shimmers with the brilliance that is to come in the later books such as It (1986) and the novellas in Different Seasons (1982) and shows that even at the beginning of his lengthy career, King is the master storyteller. Also, non-King fans have read it because of the film of the same name by Stanley Kubrick. And although King dislikes the film, it is simply a masterpiece.The highlight of this book is the rounded characters King creates. We empathise and sympathise with all three. There is a character arc for all three, especially Jack, and we see the characters change by the end of the story.The Shining is a thrilling book that I really enjoyed. I came to it after watching the film, and like all novels made into films, it gives more depth and texture to the story. It has a heart.

  The Shining by Stephen KingRating - 5*I read this along with the audiobook and it's safe to say, I'm quite pleased. This is the first Stephen King book I've read, and actually liked! The Shining had a really good story line which was dead easy to follow. The thing I did find though, is the writing is fairly repetitive throughout. Certain phrases were overused way too much;'The nap of the carpet''waxing and waning'To name a couple off the top of my head.I'm going to watch the film this weekend with my better half, but I'm unsure what to expect from it, I hear a lot of the information has been left from the book.I'm following up this book with Doctor Sleep. Wish me luck!

  I had seen the Kubrick film many times prior, including a terrifying first time watching it, and was attracted to King's written works later on. The book is identifiably in his own style but not a problem to get through despite a decent length, and develops in a totally different way to the themes on screen with subtle differences in plot. King is a renowned teller of horror but doesn't over elaborate with complicated sections of work, which means it's a major ""page turner"" and lives up to his reputation as a hard to put down author. I feel overall King is a surprise in tone to the uninitiated reader and plain addictive to devotees, due to his accessible yet thorough style resulting in a reputation as a modern day master of the genre.  His plots and ideas come from within, from darkest thoughts and it certainly echoes the fears of the reader too.

  Everybody knows ‘The Shining’, right? Come on, let’s face it, who hasn’t seen the film? The film is good, very very good but the book is something else altogether.Unsettling, unnerving, nail biting and hide behind a cushion freaky – that is exactly what I’ve been doing throughout reading it and THAT’S despite having already read it years ago. I think reading it years ago when I was much younger just didn’t cut the grade, I mustn’t have taken it in properly, but now I have and I’ve been hanging on every single word and every single thing portrayed throughout. EEK!!Oh! And not to mention the cover! Arh man. Arh man. Arh man. That cover!!!!!! It says it all. I think if you were to show just the cover to someone who knew absolutely nothing about The Shining, they’d take one look and run for miles with goosebumps covering every inch of their body. The cover is just perfect for what lies beyond it!Beyond it, you will find demons, nightmares and all things abound mercy showing it’s face … I was utterly utterly petrified! The little boy, Danny is just too frightening; he can read minds and can see some real scary thoughts inside his mum and dad’s mind, and anyone else really, however, despite this, it gets worse, as The Overlook Hotel has far worse things up its sleeve for both him and his parents! Hallucinations??? Pah! They happen, but they don’t come close to what else happens!On more than one occasion I could have easily done a Joey from Friends and hid the book in the freezer for a while, just to see if it would help me come to terms with what I was reading, or freeze the prose. Some of those passages scared the bejesus out of me especially those regarding the topiary, the fire extinguisher and oh my gosh, the woman in the bathroom of Room 217 – YIKES!!!!!!!What can I say to conclude this review other than The Shining is one of the best, if not THE best, horror stories ever to come out of any author! However, don’t sink yourself into it thinking it’ll be an easy read; at times it’s quite difficult .. but … OMG so good!!!

  A bad temper puts Jack Torrence out of his teaching job. Lucky enough to secure the position of caretaker at the Overlook Hotel the family move there for the winter. As the snow isolates them from the rest of the world strange forces take hold.As always, the book is better than the film. I watched the film first and whilst it was good, the book was hundreds of times better. Though not for everyone, I found the bad language in the book refreshing. It’s rare that you find something raw and visceral, since books so often dress up things in floral language.One of the things I found most interesting was the portrayal of alcoholism. Jack thinks about alcohol all the time and it really shows how strong you have to be to resist it. The hotel preys on weakness and perhaps if it were not for this weakness the violence would not have happened. I don’t feel this important factor is shown clearly enough in the film.I am not at all a fan of the supernatural genre. I like my realism and in terms of horror I’m not scared at all by ghost stories or things that go bump in the night. Stephen King does something remarkable, not only did I not completely hate it but it’s taught to me to be a little more open to other genres. I’m looking forward to reading more of his work.

  I have never seen the film.  I read the Shining on the back of reading IT.  I'm sadly very unimpressed.  It is scary only in a couple of places in Danny's dreams, so I do not know why it has a reputation for being scary.  It is often very dull, with unnecessary descriptions of the mundane even towards the denouement.  It feels woefully underdeveloped in terms of its own internal mythology, yet bloated with needless character backstory that still fails to make you care for any of the characters.  Sorry Mr King, not for me.

  This tale of a troubled man hired to care for a remote mountain resort over the winter, his loyal wife, and their uniquely gifted son slowly but steadily unfolds as secrets from the Overlook Hotel’s past are revealed, and the hotel itself attempts to claim the very souls of the Torrance family.Despite being a longtime fan of the singular Stephen King, I feel that my acquaintance with his work is depressingly lacking.  While I’ve read plenty by him, I have yet to get to some of his most celebrated and/or popular contributions.  I consider myself a fan of the man, but how can one consider himself as such if he has yet to read the Dark Tower series, or The Stand?I picked up The Shining, so famous today and yet untouched by myself, on a whim, primarily because it had suddenly come to my attention that a sequel had been written.  Seeing as how very few of King’s works has ever played recipient to a bona-fide follow-up, I figured that my reading of one of his most famous pieces was long overdue, especially given its treatment by other mediums of entertainment.I have, of course, seen Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation.  Who hasn’t?  It’s a classic work of cinematic horror, and one of the few “older” frightfests that genuinely disturbs me whenever I see it.  This, unfortunately, imposed a bit of a problem on my reading of the source material, because much of that iconic flick has become so permanently ingrained in the cultural imagination that it’s difficult to accept the lack of so many a notable scene, regardless of its status as the original.No “Here’s Johnny!”No “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.”No “Come play with us, Danny.”Of course, this isn’t any fault of the author.  In fact, I can now understand in some ways why King has been so dismissive of Kubrick’s film since its release, despite its status as being a definitive piece of work in both the horror genre and in the general Hollywood canon.Both, I think, are fantastic.  Both tell a particular story and both tell it well.  They simply go about it in very different ways.King’s original is, as one may expect, rife with stream-of-consciousness devices, the occasional bit of corniness, and plot developments that border on the fantastical, all helped along by plenty of over-the-top scenes rife with violence and the supernatural.I can understand that King is a polarizing author.  The above characteristics either make him an endearing storyteller of fascinating power or a ridiculous hack who buries his good ideas in schlock and inanity.Personally, I adore the man.  His books are utterly captivating, easy to pick up and difficult to put down.  It’s been some time since I’ve devoured a book as quickly as I did this one, and doing so reinforced my love of King’s style.  His incessant use of flashbacks and short reiterations of interwoven thoughts and memories is absorbing, seamless (though one must admittedly get used to it first), and instantly effective at building a sense of dread.King is a master at captivation.  No matter how ridiculous his tales, no matter how frustrating his overabundance of explanation, he knows how to keep you at attention.  He knows how to entertain, to play the crowd and keep their eyes focused on him and him alone.  And this is because he knows how to scare.The Shining did something that few books before have ever managed to do: frighten me.  No matter that I had seen the film numerous times already.  No matter that I had at least a general idea of what would happen throughout the story.  No matter that it was only words on a page and not visceral images captured by the camera lens.  Through only his pen, King manages to make the darkness of my room eerie and uncomfortable.  His imagery and sense of scene is effortlessly able to construct a clear picture in the imagination, stark and ghastly and ugly.  He knows when to keep it subtle, to play on the fear of the unseen and the unknown, but he also knows when to fling the demons into the light, to allow them to be inspected and scrutinized and made flesh.  Reading this book, as with any other King book, is to have a silver screen clear in your mind, filled with the ghostly terrors of a wicked fantasy made distinct.King also knows how to exploit the inherit fright in the everyday.  The vicious gore and otherworldly specters are nothing to laugh at, to be sure, but the worst terrors are those that come from the grounded and unimportant.  Under his hand, King makes empty hallways terrifying, exploiting that sense of unease that comes with quiet and solitude to excellent effect.  Suddenly, the sounds of an elevator moving between floors becomes a great deal scarier than the appearance of an angry ghost.  Suddenly, in the more irrational parts of your mind, you are afraid, because you are there.  You are not in bed staring at a page of dreams and fancy.  No, you are in that enormous and empty resort, hearing the mechanical whine of a machine that should not be running, and you are terrified.What helps further this is the sense of sympathy brought on by the group of people so unfortunate to be trapped in this very situation.  They stand out, certainly, but also function as skins that one is able to slip into and become.  The Torrence family as a whole is so much more real here than in the film.  Each is, at one point or another, easily connected with.Jack is a great deal more likeable, though still a simple thing to hate when the clock strikes and all hell breaks loose.  Nicholson’s portrayal turned the character into an uncomfortable, short-tempered twat from the start, whose eventual defeat by his son elicits little, if any, sympathy.  King’s original mold is one with definitive, infuriating flaws, but one also with clear traits of love and regret.  There is a sense of humanity to his past and to his (initial) treatment of his family, and the eventual loss of his sanity turns his tale into a tragic one.Wendy, meanwhile, is much the same as Shelley Duval’s interpretation of the character, though perhaps a tad less hysterical.  She too has her faults, but she exhibits a level-headedness and intelligence throughout the whole of her ordeal that her shortcomings are easily forgiven.Danny, last of all, is so much more complex within the novel than he is on screen, with a mixture of natural innocence and unnatural maturity that makes him immediately compelling.  Getting inside of his head and his visions is fascinating and gives the story much of its suspense.  My only complaint is that I dread seeing such a sweet character turned into something much more monstrous in Doctor Sleep.  Though I suppose to expect anything less from King would be foolhardy.Despite its length, The Shining is a remarkably quick read.  It’s frightening, it’s complex, and it’s a wild ride.  True, the author can get bogged down in tedious descriptions and exposition, and lose the power of his subtlety with the inevitable climax of extravagance that tends to make an appearance near the end, but the plot is no less compelling because of either tendency.

  When people think of Stephen King this book is always one of the first that comes to mind. The Shining really does show off why Stephen King is one of the most loved storytellers, giving us a truly great story.Now whilst the book is one of his best in terms of story, it is not one of his best when it comes to his writing. I’m sure there are many people who will disagree with me, but personally I believe this to be one of his more poorly written books. Due to how great the story is such a thing is quite easy to overlook, nevertheless it does not remove the point. If you are not familiar with his work then you are liable to question why so many people are such big fans.Another point I would like to make, is that there are numerous large differences to the movie. If you’re coming into the book expecting it to be just like the movie then you are in for a big surprise. With a very small cast we’re able to get into the heads of all the characters, watching events play out (with many events never coming to be in the film).Overall, it is another great King book.

  I actually set out to read this solely for the 'scare factor' but what I found, wasn't just a horrific portrayal of violence and a menacing father. But also an intense read from the son's point of view.I had previously seen the move of The Shining and did think the novel would be very similar. I learned very quickly that the novel, is far better in construction, intensity and scares!!!!!!As much as I did enjoy this novel and the fear element. I was not brave enough to read it late at night or in the dark. I was not willing to be scared senseless and alone in the dark, cursing Stephen King for being such a genius! lolA great novel, which really should be a modern classic, by now. 5*

  I had been meaning to read this book for years and finally got round too it, knowing the hype the novel has I was hoping it wasn’t going to be a let down... and it wasn’t I thought it was a really well written book! For someone who doesn’t like horror films this book was perfect , I didn’t really find it scary but I did think that it was a great book and it held onto my attention, playing with my imagination. I would definitely read more of his books!

  I first read THE SHINING when I was 17, and with its belated sequel DOCTOR SLEEP sitting by my bed waiting to be consumed, I thought I’d revisit the spooky corridors of The Overlook Hotel.THE SHINING is among King’s most famous and iconic works; if you’re reading this, you’ll know what its about. Everything shines; six-year-old Danny shines, he is psychic, and gets visions from his imaginary friend, he can get hints of the future, or of possible futures, he can see dead things, things from long ago that linger. His parents, Jack and Wendy, like many characters in the book, also shine, but to a much lesser extent. King postulates that THE SHINING is a clairvoyance, a psychic sixth-sense that is latent in everyone, but not active; many people shine to a greater or lesser extent; some people have just a touch – intuition – but a few really shine on, doc, much like Danny Torrance here, and the Hotel’s cook, Halloran, who also has it big.The Overlook is a huge luxury hotel, high in the Colorado mountains, with a long, dark, history: it too shines, like a beacon, it shines it’s past to sensitive folk, the hotel is alive, it is The Overlook, it watches. When it gets a hint of the raw shining power in young Danny, it wants him, it lures him, casts its trap, and uses the old ghosts within Jack, ghosts of failure, and alcoholism, of despair and guilt, to make its catch. Jack, and Wendy, are haunted themselves, long before they get to the hotel, and once the Overlook has got its claws in, and the snows have closed around them, in their freezing isolation, the hotel strikes; through Jack’s ambition to succeed, it uses him, plays him like a marionette, to get what it wants. Had the hotel been successful, only King’s imagination knows how terrible the Overlook could have become.So, then, THE SHINING, King’s 3rd novel, is a ghost-story with as many floors as the Overlook itself. It is largely about character, and about Jack’s journey from a problematic but loving husband and father, to a psychotic puppet of evil. Jack’s descent into madness is described at length; for me, some of it worked, and some didn’t quite, but I believed totally in Jack’s alcoholism, and family background, his character. Character is King’s best attribute; had he been writing successfully for 40 years in a genre other than horror, he would long ago have been widely recognised for his skills with character.The story is a classic one, a gem of a story, iconic; the isolation, the background, the hedge animals, the shining, all great stuff, skilfully put together. I thought generally the writing was good here, although not as time-polished as some other novels, and occasionally I lost the pace in a few places. Conversely, though, in some places the writing shines. I loved the moment when Jack, locked in a bolted pantry by his wife, has been pounding on the metal door for hours; it is definitely locked, he is secure. Then Jack begins to talk to the hotel, to an ex-caretaker on the other side of the door, a ghost that slides along the bolt...  Prose-wise, and particularly, I loved this bit, some fine evocative writing:  Danny was still awake long after his parents’ false sleep had become the real thing. He rolled in  his bed, twisting the sheets, grappling with a problem years too big for him, awake in the night like  a single sentinel on picket. And sometime after midnight, he slept too and then only the wind was  awake, prying at the hotel and hooting in its gables under the bright gimlet gaze of the stars.The novel has pace, increasingly so, and I waited until I had a spare two hours to read the final quarter or so in one sitting. If you have only ever seen the film [ok but different] or the miniseries [more faithful], and you like that sort of thing, then you certainly should read, or re-read, THE SHINING. It is a fabulous idea, fabulous story, well-written, and is a 9/10 novel, but for me personally doesn’t quite top some later works like THE DEAD ZONE, DOLORES CLAIBORNE, THE GREEN MILE, or DIFFERENT SEASONS.

  The Shining is the fourth novel by popular American author, Stephen King. Unemployed professor of literature and recovering alcoholic, Jack Torrance takes a job as winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in the mountains of Colorado. His wife, Wendy is hopeful he can conquer his demons during their half year in the mountains and get on with his writing. His five year old son, Daniel, is plagued by pre-cognitive visions that seem to be facilitated by his imaginary friend, Tony; they are often pleasant but sometimes uncomfortable and occasionally downright terrifying. When the family arrives at the Overlook, the cook, Dick Hallorann takes Daniel aside and tells him he “shines”, and gives him some welcome reassurance and advice. The Overlook hotel has links to underworld characters and has been the scene of murders, suicides and gangland-style executions. Danny senses in the Overlook a certain malevolence, a certain power, and feels the presence of past victims. After some months of almost idyllic existence, the hotel and the Torrance family are cut off from the town of Sidewinder by heavy snowfalls and impassable roads. And then the hotel begins to exert its influence on Jack and his family. Or is it just an alcoholic succumbing to cabin fever?  King expertly portrays alcoholism and the descent into psychosis, and gives the reader characters of some complexity who find themselves rushing headlong into a heart-stopping climax. With Danny’s narration, King uses wordplay to highlight the ambiguity of spoken English. Readers who have seen the 1980 Kubrick movie (which departs markedly from the book and disappointed King) will picture Jack Nicholson as Torrance (despite his lack of blonde hair). King once again proves he is a master story-teller, as readers who make the effort to reread this as a prequel to Doctor Sleep will discover afresh. A bestseller that is a brilliant read.

  The Shining, by Stephen King, was my first experience of this prolific author. I do not enjoy being frightened so generally avoid the horror genre in both books and films. However, when the opportunity to read and review what is regarded by some as his first tour de force, I decided that I could benefit from being able to form my own opinion about the work of a writer who, in interviews, has voiced some perceptive thoughts.The book tells the tale of a young family on a downward spiral. The son has a gift, the Shining, which is presented to the reader in it's most believable form when described through the eyes of the child. His father is a recovering alcoholic with a vicious temper whilst his mother fights her own childhood demons. Her character is less rounded for much of the story but, by the end of the book, has been developed enough to allow her to play her part convincingly. Both parents have been victims of childhood abuse and the scars affect much of what they do.At the beginning of the book the father has lost his teaching job and, as a result, the family is in financial straits. To tide them over he agrees to become winter caretaker of a large hotel in the mountains which will be cut off by heavy snow for many months. Naturally the hotel is haunted, although it's true power is only revealed slowly to the reader as the story progresses. The build up of tension is masterfully done and I can see why so many of King's books have been adapted for the big screen.It is also easy to see why this author is a best seller. The book is a page turner, easy to read with a good balance of taut plot and character development. Nothing is overdone and the elements of horror are imaginatively crafted. In the book's blurb King is described as a master storyteller and I would not quibble with this title.There was something about his style of writing though that just didn't do it for me. I could appreciate the clever ways in which the back story was introduced; the varied cast of characters each added something to the tale and were believable; the settings were well described and the hotel in particular was presented to the reader in enough detail to make them feel that they were alongside the family, wanting to shout out 'don't go there!' when advice was ignored and key rooms explored.The book was clever, slick and well written, yet still I felt a lack of something. It almost felt too text book, as if the author knew how to write a best seller and did just that. It was not formulaic in the way so many popular books can appear, but for all the tension and development it did not touch me emotionally.Having said all of that, I am still glad that I read it. It was enjoyable and entertaining which is as much as many readers will look for in a book. It was also rather scary. I doubt that I will feel comfortable around topiary animals ever again.(My copy of this book was provided by Goodreads and the publisher as part of a First Reads giveaway.)

  The story starts off with the 'Job Interview'. Here we are introduced to Jack Torrence, an aspiring author, who has applied for the position of a winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies. He is interviewed by the Manager, Mr Stuart Ullman, who warns Jack that a previous caretaker developed 'cabin fever' and ended up murdering his family before killing himself. However, Jack is not put off by this or the fact that he, his wife and son Danny will be living in this sprawling, empty hotel during the harsh, winter months when they will, at times, be totally cut off from civilisation. Jack is a recovering alcoholic with anger issues and feels that the solitude will give him the time to write and to re-connect with his wife and child. As with most horror stories, things don't quite go to plan......Stephen King is a master storyteller and this book contains some real top-notch writing. It won't be everyone's cup of tea because if you are not a fan of psychological horror stories then you may not completely buy into The Shining. That said, this really is a damn good read. Mr King does occasionally over-cook his narrative and is guilty of filling the pages with more descriptive passages that some folk may find to be strictly necessary. But eh, overall, I think this is a great work of fiction and I absolutely loved the time I spent with it. Now I'm ready for Doctor Sleep!

  I've just finished re-reading The Shining to bring me up to speed before I read Doctor Sleep.  Damn, I forgot how scary it was!Although not one of my favourite Stephen King books, The Shining does deserve its place as a modern horror classic.  If you're not already familiar with the plot from popular culture or the (vastly inferior) movie, it's really a twist on the typical ""haunted house"" story.Jack Torrance is a recovering alcoholic, who has recently been fired from his college job due to losing his temper with a student.  He is recommended for the job of a winter caretaker at the remote Overlook Hotel, and while he needs the money, he also thinks a spot of isolation with his family might be just the opportunity he needs to kick-start his writing career.His young son Danny thinks otherwise. Blessed/cursed with the titular ""shining"", Danny has psychic visions of past events and possible futures, and has a bad feeling about the hotel.  But he loves his dad, and knows that Jack badly needs this job, so he keeps quiet and hopes for the best.Of course, Danny's worst nightmares come true once the family is settled in the Overlook and cut off from the outside world. Riddled with ghosts and an overwhelming power of evil, the hotel wants this special little boy for itself, and the best way to get to him is through his troubled father.Although I do think the book is slightly over-long and could have done with a little more editing, it really succeeds in building up the feeling of claustrophobia and menace.  Jack's descent into madness feels horribly plausible, and there are some scenes which definitely gave me nightmares.  The Shining plays on both deep-rooted childhood fears and on a level of more psychological horror, so there are chills on every level.While the limited cast of characters are well fleshed out, I did find it hard to empathise with them. Even at the beginning of the novel, Jack come across as quite an unlikeable character, and it would have been nice to have seen things more from Wendy's point of view, to give an insight into what things were like at the beginning of their relationship.  Compared to other King books, there is a lack of warmth and heart to The Shining, which is the reason I haven't given it top marks.  Still, it was a far better and scarier read than I remembered, and will rightly be remembered for years to come.

  i immediately grasped the chance to watch Kings Teleplay of his own novel..23 years belatedly but it was an interval where i had grown to actually start to believe that the myriad flaws in Kubricks(interpretation??) could be forgiven...however i do so clearly remember the utter let down of my first viewing in 1980 (in Wimbledons Odeon) where i had seen BLADERUNNER and MIDNIGHT EXPRESS..now think any other actor as Nexus 6 than Rutger Hauer..or the junkie institutionalised beatnik of John Hurt in the latter....Shelley Duvall was a joke ..Nicholson chewed scenery and the KID!! poor wee lad was as much Danny Torrance as i am the queen of Sheba?? mmIn short Kings 4 and a half expansive beautifully cast version has you from the start.. I suspended my belief as required Kubricks version was more like a rubricks cube with a nailed on snowy maze...IMDB 8.7 for Kubricks????you should be ashamed!!

  I've often said I'm not that practiced a horror reader. I read Stephen King's Carrie in grammar school and I've read some horror since starting the blog, but after watching the film IT for five minutes and having nightmares for two nights straight, I didn't touch another horror novel for well over a decade and I never dared pick up another King book; until now, that is. When Hodderscape sent me their second pick in the Hodderscape Review Project and I opened the envelop to find The Shining inside, my first thought was: 'Oh, no! What if I flunk out halfway through, due to being too scared?' Turns out that fear was rather unnecessary, because while it has some seriously creepy moments, I didn't find The Shining that scary. I did find it to be very much a psychological mind game, where for a while I wondered how much of it was true and how much of it was just in the heads of Jack and Danny. And that is exactly the kind of creepy I like, as Lindqvist's Harbor has already proven.More than a horror novel, The Shining is essentially a character study and one of the most important characters is the Overlook itself. This grand old place has a mind and a life of its own and while at the start of the novel all the myths about it seem like so much superstition, King slowly but surely makes those superstitions and tales of haunting become a shattering reality. King creates an interesting history for his Overlook, with some fun winks at actually historical personages. I especially liked the hotel's previous owner, Horace Derwent, who for all intents and purposes reminded me of Howard Hughes. But there are also numerous famous stars of the big screen who stayed at the Overlook and several presidents. All of it adds to the hotel's character, both in a literal and a figurative sense.Still, however creepy the Overlook was, what - or rather who - freaked me out the most, was Jack Torrance, Danny's dad. I never got a good lock on Jack. On the one hand he seemed sympathetic, on the other hand he was the worst kind of unstable, abusive alcoholic; the kind that keeps finding excuses for his behaviour and whose mood can flip-flop in an instant. His gradual decompensation was awful to watch, because it's inexorable and the reader is unsure whether it is just his mental instability and cabin fever that is driving him crazy or there is actually some malign influence from the hotel. To me, what happens to Jack - the slow erasure of equilibrium, the gradual blurring of the lines between reality and hallucination - is a hundred times more scary than a crazy hotel that wants to kill me, probably because I can imagine someone actually losing his mind, but I'm less likely to run across a murderous hotel.The Shining's other main character is Danny. I liked Danny, though he seemed a bit precocious. No five-year-old is likely to be that smart or well-spoken or would keep his cool that well. Like his father, for the longest time I wasn't sure whether Danny wasn't actually hallucinating or losing his grip on reality, rather than suffering some supernatural invasion, even if his 'shine' - his ability to read people's minds - is established as true quite early on. The other characters with large parts to play are Wendy, Jack's wife and Danny's mother, and Mr Hallorann, the hotel's cook, who has a large shining gift himself. I enjoyed Wendy's story arc very much. At first I just couldn't see why she didn't just leave, but I liked how strong she was in the second half of the book and the lengths she goes through to keep Danny and herself safe. While Mr Hallorann is very likeable, I rather felt he was a Chekov's gun, placed there at the family's arrival and sure to be recalled when necessary; his role in the plot and its development was clear from the get go, which kind of killed the suspense in his arc.In the end, while I really liked the book, I was disappointed with its denouement; there is this constant build-up to the fact that someone is going to die and in the end they sort of do, but I found that for the most part it was disappointing who died and why or how. Why was I disappointed by the whom? Because it was the obvious, and in some ways only, choice and while it worked as a redemption of sorts, it still felt too pat. It's not that I wanted there to be more blood and gore, because I generally dislike blood and gore, but in the end I never doubted who would make it out alive, which took away a bit of the suspense of the ending.Have I been converted to the writing of Stephen King? Yes and no. The Shining has taught me that I can definitely handle his scary and I enjoyed his writing style very much, but am I going to seek out everything he's written? Probably not. But I definitely see why King is one of the grand masters of horror and why The Shining is a classic of the genre. If you're interested in horror, then The Shining is a must-read. And if you truly adore this book and its characters, you'll be able to reunite with some of them quite soon, as King's long-awaited sequel to The Shining, Doctor Sleep, is released in October.This book was provided for review by Hodderscape as part of their Hodderscape Review Project.

  I have always seen references to The Shining whether it's parodies (The Simpsons TreeHouse Horror) or mentioned fondly on TV programs so I had high hopes of being spooked from this novel. Apart from a few moving twigs from possessed hedges there weren't as many essences to iconic scenes in the novel as per usual for a movie adaptation, however since they were thought to be the better parts i.e The Twins and when Jack Torrance attacks his wife shouting HERE'S JOHNNY! It was a bit of an anti-climax towards the end of the book.The story telling certainly is what made up the novel, it's my first book by Stephen King and his narration did live up to my expectations. I really enjoyed reading chapters between Wendy and Danny, King really captured the mind of a kid putting aside his talents which often left him isolated, the characters were easily likable and with a believable as though you knew these people from somewhere in your life.I just felt Jack's and Wendy's background weren't entirely concluded, not that it affected the story or the realism between their unhappy marriage. Both come from very traumatic and unhappy childhoods which secretly haunt them today but in the end I felt as though the sub-plots had been dropped somewhere, particularly for Wendy and her relationship between her mother since King tends to flip between time zones mainly for Jack uncovering his horrific drinking past but not so much with Wendy.The tension was certainly the best part of the story, though long before the present day when he was out of on the lash with his associate and had a mysterious accident involving a kid whilst drink driving. That scared Jack enough to stop the drinking when neither of them could find the body, that was a good sub-plot, but again, dropped from what could have made a comeback to Jack's life in the hotel.There wasn't really anything thought provoking or too clever when it came to the ghosts of the Overlook and when something did go bump in the night it ended up being a Paranormal Activity film where nothing serious happens and the hairs on the back of my neck fall down in disappointment.Although I haven't seen the film, I've seen snippets of Jack Nicholson's acting and the scene's Kubrick added as mentioned above and he seemed to have made a better story out of what Stephen King started.One thing I advise though, if you're going to read it, don't read in the bath!

  I've seen the film a dozen times and only just got round to reading the novel, never being much of a King fan. I was shocked at how deeply the novel delved into the psyche of each character, something skimmed over in the film which seemed to concentrate on atmospherics and photography. At least four or five major threads in the novel were dumped unceremoniously for the film. It's really a different beast entirely... and so is Jack Torrance, a fully-fleshed anti-hero who just can't quite get over the drinkies and becomes enmeshed in the creepiest hotel ever in the depth of a murderous winter. I love Danny's character in the novel - he comes across as a truly 'gifted' but fundamentally ordinary little boy who is at turns curious, terrified and resigned to his fate as one who can 'shine.' King can ratchet up the terror like no other writer, then quell the tremors with a superbly likeable character such as Hallorann. It's a modern classic, and though Kubrick created a chilling horror film from this, you really can't say they're from the same stable in terms of depth, character and a good dollop of poignancy, to boot. Superb.

  Great book and an absolute steal for £3.49 with the ace new retro 'Halloween special' design cover. Almost makes you want to buy the other three to complete the 'set' each which have the same angular design. Although they do seem to be a strange choice of titles to bring out like this (unless they intend to do them all). The Shining is classic, Christine is pretty good too. I always found Bag Of Bones and strange one, almost as if it was written by someone else. 'Cell' was just, er, in my opinion, pretty god damn awful. Anyhoo, yup, you can't go wrong with this one, great book at a great price.

  'Jack Torrance looked back over his shoulder once into the impenetrable,musty-smelling darkness and thought that if there was ever a place that should have ghosts, this was it.'---My thoughts---This is the second book I've read by Stephen King after hearing a lot about both the book and the film. I've never seen the film, but plan on watching it now that I've finished the book, to see how it differs. I have to say that I was drawn in from the first few pages of this book, and this doesn't often happen for me. Usually I have to get a chapter or two into a book, when the story starts to move forward, to really be sucked into it. There was just something about the style of writing, and Jack's character that had me drawn into the story from the very start.Whilst I wouldn't say I was scared by this book, it was definitely creepy. Stephen King's ability to make me visualise everything really added to the eeriness of the story, and also to my complete immersion in the lives of the Torrance family. Every detail was easy to imagine, right down to the carpet in the Hotel, so when it came to Danny's visions, the images were very vivid in my mind.I always enjoy seeing the story through different points of view, and this book was no different. The majority of the story is told through Jack and Danny's eyes, with Danny being the first to encounter the dangers in the Hotel. I really enjoyed seeing how Danny, who is just five years old, deals with the horrors that are unfolding before his eyes. Although there are times when he's understandably terrified, the majority of the time he hides his emotions from his parents so that he doesn't scare them away from The Overlook, as he thinks that they are happy there. For such a young child, the way that he handles his visions is incredible; if I saw the things that he saw, I'd be running straight out of that Hotel.Jack's character is an interesting one. He often reflects on his past mistakes and deeply regrets them, and he's determined to make a better life for his family, especially his son. Every day without a drink is a struggle for Jack, and when the Hotel is cut off by heavy snow, the isolation, rather than helping him, only makes this worse for Jack. The Hotel finds a way to get to him, and he slowly starts to lose his mind bit by bit, until he doesn't know himself anymore. The decline of Jack's mind was central to the story, and one of the most interesting parts for me, watching him losing a part of himself every day. His thoughts could be confusing at times, but this cemented the fact that the Hotel was starting to get to him.I think it's time I mentioned Wendy, Jack's wife. Wendy has had a lot of problems to face before The Overlook Hotel, with her husband being prone to outbursts of anger, and his drinking problems. Struggling with the decision of what's best for Danny, Wendy believes that The Overlook Hotel could be good for them as a family, and maybe bring her and Jack back together. While at The Overlook, Wendy must now come to terms with the fact that her son is in danger not just from Jack, but from the Hotel itself. I really admired Wendy's character, and her protection of her son. The events unfolding at The Overlook are terrifying, but Wendy's first thought is always her son and how she can keep him out of danger. As her husband starts to succumb to the Hotel, Wendy is the one trying to hold everything together and keep her son safe.Overall, I just couldn't put his book down. I spent three hours reading it in one morning,determined to finish it and see the outcome. My Kindle Edition had quite a few spelling mistakes, which at times was frustrating and distracting, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story. If you're looking for a great psychological horror read, you should definitely pick yourself up a copy of The Shining.

  After deciding that it was time to finally get round to reading this much-vaunted horror classic, I noted that it was published as long ago as 1977, and is thus one of King's early works. What surprised me even more, therefore, is how well-written the book is and how King, even at this early stage, was in command of the 'toolbox' that he writes about in his memoir, 'On Writing'. True, as he notes in his retrospective introduction, some of the prose seems a little cocky at times, but I did not feel that this detracted from this unnerving tale.The story takes a little while to get going as King provides background on Jack Torrance and his misfortunes, but once the terrors of the Overlook fully reveal themselves, it is difficult to put the book down. As scary as characters like the Dogman are, for me, the most eerie parts centered on things which were only alluded to obliquely, such as when Jack Torrance finds a garbled poem and a blood-spattered cloth or rag in the Overlook's basement. Moreover, as interesting and fast-paced as the main plot was (Jack Torrance's descent into madness and Dick Hallorann's desperate race to the hotel), I rather wished that we could have learned more of the subplot of the Overlook's history and the sinister Horace Derwent. I felt that the depredations of Derwent and his retinue could have provided a fine story in itself.This is vintage King, and is undoubtedly among his best books.

  The Shining was the first Stephen King book I read, I was 14, after my dad couldn't stop reccomending him for years on end. I was a fan of the Stanley Kubrick movie which was why I picked the Shining as a first book and was looking forward to reading it especially because people were saying the book was better than the movie. Right from the first 200 pages, I was dissapointed, there were endless in depth descriptions of EVERY room in the hotel and there were scenes that were pointless and could've easily been taken out such as Jack looking in the basement. After 150 or so pages, I was on the verge of giving up on it but luckily I stuck with it and after about 215 odd pages, the story starts to get going and become interesting. However, even after that, There are still some excessive descriptions and pointless scenes but there aren't as many as the beginning. Overall, I did enjoy The Shining but I would of liked it more if King reduced the 500 page book to around maybe 280-300 pages with all the excessive backstorys, descriptions and unnecessary scenes taken out to make it a better paced novel. I much preferred his other books such as Pet Sematary, Green Mile, Misery, 11.22.63 etc I even preferred the Kubrick movie even though King hated it with a passion, but at least the movie didn't include most of the parts I found boring and the excessive backstory

  This is a must read for any horror fan, I didnt find it scary but weirdly its one of the very few books that actually gave me nightmares. So much better and more detailed than the film so stop reading this and start reading the shining! You won't regret it.

  Over a year ago on TV, I managed to stumble upon The Shining. The genre of horror has never been one of my particular favourites, but that film to me was not delibrately scary like most other horrors. What it did possess in my mind was a certain chill factor and a gripping story that made it an epic horror film.As far as books are concerned, The Shining seemed like a good place to start as far as fiction. My sister has always been a fan of Stephen King, so I was intrigued to see what King was like as a storyteller.Precisely it probably took me about a month to read, about a chapter every night or around that mark. The reason being is I did not want to lose my place as to where the story was going. Well, earlier tonight, I had finally finished reading it.In my opinion, this is the best book I have read so far. The story was well layed out in 58 chapters in 5 seperate sections and thus is quite easy to follow. The words were quite difficult to understand, but they have hold the reader back from the concept of the tale.In modest terms, I can not say whether I like the book or the film more as they both have their own appeal. Certainly the novel is much more scarier, with scenes that delve deeper into the supernatural and certainly some differences that Stanley Kubrick probably could not afford to film.I felt the ending in the book was a lot more uplifting than the one on the film. I also found the violence was a lot more gruesome and King can certainly create vivid images that stick in your head.Whether it is the best horror novel is up to you, but this certainly one of the best ones to have been written. Now we know the scariest thing is not a flesh eating monster.

  I have just re-read The Shining after many, many years and I forgot how scary it really is. I know Stephen King doesn't always get the credit he deserves for his books and admittedly he's written some duds (in my opinion) but The Shining is just simply an amazing horror novel. It has all the ingredients required of a horror novel to the point where you start shutting doors behind you in your own house and leaving the landing light on, it really does get to you that much. There is far more depth to Jack than you would imagine and I love the way the book delves into his and Wendy's past to give you an idea as to why they are how they are now.  This is definitely one of the best King novels and one of my favourites which I am sure I will re-read again and again (when I am less scared!).I have heard today that there is a sequel coming out next year called (I think) Doctor Sleep about Danny as his life as progressed and more 'shining' activities. Let's hope it does The Shining justice.

  Supernatural thriller, vaguely scary, with elements of psychological complexity. Combines impressionable, memorable human 'myths' - psychic forces ('the shine') - with large house with a dark past, soaked in negative human tendencies.Strong characterisation and tension, clever and gradual crescendo to typical over-drawn out, rather unconvincing 'King' confrontation. Satisfying action-wise but rather shallow, straight-forward, unsubtle. Well worth the ride tho - clever connections, atmospheres, expectancy - some real insights, character depth of struggling couple exposed to further degradations, tragedies - but bravery, inner strength holds sway.Such themes emerge clearer here, with greater background and inner detail, obviously than with Kubrick's merely impressionable visual rendering. The novel has more of a believable account of Jack's descent into the Overlook's darkness. Family complex relationships also vividly described. People's vulnerabilities, inner difficulties, exploited by a building, an abstract force, to become real evil, convinced into becoming evil.
"
"
  Let me start by saying, before reading this book most of my fears were the typical, rational ones. Since I've read it, hedges, especially those in the shape of animals, haunt me.But I guess that's the beauty of King, he can make even the smallest of details become the most significant parts of the story.The Shining has every element of the ideal horror/supernatural story. The flow of the chapters keep you on your toes, and throughout he manages to maintain a flicker of hope, in Danny and his creepy, imaginary  (or maybe not) friend.An incredible book, that should be read, with the lights off, on a quiet winter's night.

  Personally, I consider Shining (the novel) as one of the best horror stories ever written. But the horror is completely psychological, not physical, so don't expect a great deal of action. In the physical sense, I mean. If I had to summarise the plot of The Shining, I would go like this.""An ex-alcoholic with his wife and young, telepathic son takes up the job of a winter caretaker in a remote mountain hotel full of malevolent spirits or supernatural forces, which slowly force him back into a kind of alcoholic haze, and then try to make him murder his family; a black chef in the hotel, also telepathic, responds to the boy's mental summons and rushes back to the hotel, managing to save the wife and the boy, though the father dies when the hotel's boiler explodes and the hotel burns down.""That is sum and substance of the story, told in about 90 words. I think it is a truism that most, if not all, of Stephen King's novels can be easily summarised in less than 150 words (or less). The number of characters in his books is usually small, which rather limits the scope for action, I suppose. Nor do his novels always have completely happy endings of the variety ""and finally, they got married and lived happily ever after"". In fact, many of them happen to end with the partial/complete destruction of the protagonist's life and/or that of his family.Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Shining, Pet Semetary, Thinner, to name but a few examples...But what his fans love is the way he builds up the characters, the fine detail in the situations, the accurate portrayal of the American way of life, and the various situations that his characters go through. Add to that the relentlessly growing tension, the feeling of being utterly lost and helpless, and of triumphing (sometimes) against nearly insurmountable odds, and you have a classic recipe which often works beautifully for King.In fact, the somewhat unhappy endings to his stories don't make them unappealing to his readers. Au contraire, they only serve to add to the gripping realism of the stories (aren't real lives often a mix of happy and sad events, rather than one or the other exclusively?), and make them more plausible, and ""real"". Thus, the reader is drawn into the story/novel, and is soon lost in it.I think, in general, assessing his books boils down to this. If you are a diehard action fan, and expect each chapter to bring up gripping, racy or relentless set of activities, you aren't going to be very satisfied with King overall. Don't expect a great deal of bloodbath or gore either, or a large cast, or amazing events. Instead, be prepared to accept the novel the way it is, ""yield"" to it, and wait for the thrill, the tension to build up. Most of the times, you won't be disappointed.I think King subscribes to the philosophy (like many of his fans) that it is all in the mind. Real horror is when you FEEL it, when your mind is absolutely pulverized by a feeling of terror - even though nothing much may be happening in the outside world. I think his short-story ""Gramma"" epitomises this approach. It is easily the scariest short story I have EVER read, but the action in it is as close to ZERO as it can possibly get in a story! All that happens is that a eleven-year old boy sits alone in the house, drinking his milk and eating his cookies, and RECALLING things in his mind, while his evil-witch grandmother dies in the adjoining bedroom and strong winds rage outside. That's it, folks.But, oh boy, when you finish the story, does the tension, and the gripping fear, leave you totally drained!!That is the beauty of King's books. The Shining is probably the best example of this.
"
"
  I highly recommend this to anyone, it had me hanging on every word and painted such a clear picture in your mind it was like watching a film. I never realised how different the book is from the film and this really blew it out of the water. This is probably now my favourite book of all time
"
"
  This book had had a lot of good reviews and i have been encouraged by friends and family to read this book and i assure you it doesn't let you down.It is relatively slow paced throughout the beginning of the book which i understand would make people get bored of the book, but don't give up on it! It leads extremely well to the rest of the book so be patient it will be worth it. This book is defiantly a thriller it isn't as scary as other books i have previously read however the suspense in the book and the development of the characters especially the main character of the book Jack Torrance made it just as good if not better than more scarier books.This book it amazing i recommend it for anyone looking for a thrill and who also doesn't mind long paced beginnings.
"
"
  After much hesitation, I read the Shining through recommendation. I'm so glad that I did, as King's storytelling is at it's best- this book has the ability to make you jump in terror and excitement at the same time. The book is slow to start, which I have found with many of King's works, but give it time and you will be absolutely enthralled by the setting and brilliant characters. This book is a chilling read, particularly the topiary animals which come to live in sinister circumstances. At times, you are at the edge of your seat, hiding behind a cushion. King has done it again- sophisticated and intelligent story telling!Enjoy- complete with cushion to hide behind!

  ok we know King can be weird but after a promising start it goes down hill into a confused weirdness
"
"
  Stephen king books differ from the usual horror novels in that I find them compelling reading but also deeply disturbing. Definitely not a relaxing read. Sometimes I am glad when I have finished the book.The Shining is compelling and gripping and as usual Mr King builds up the suspense and foreboding from the start, until you feel that you must look through a magazine full of furry kittens to relieve the tension.

  The majority of people I imagine readig this have seen the Kubrick film and are expecting something similar. This is a mistake. The Kubrick version dramatically deviated from this story, and yet imrpoved on it so much that it is the only film I have seen to surpass the novel which preceded it.So, we have a dysfunctional family going to stay in the Outlook hotel in a range of mountains that we know early on are going to be cut off by snow. The son (Danny) 'shines', which is a bit ambiguous, and basically allows him to communicate with other 'shiners', and also to have premonitions of the future, relayed by an imaginary friend. He can also see the after images of violence. The father is a reformed alchoholic who has been violent to his son before, and the wife is rather stronger than Kubricks Wendy, and is ultimately the heroine.The stage is set. The Hotel has a violent history. This is revealed both by Dannys visions and by Jack (the father), who finds papers in the cellar which gradual reveal the extent of the corruption. Jack tries to write his novel, but begins to be manipulated by the hotel itself, and descends into madness, fuelled by alchohol, which can only be imaginary (you'll see).It is the hotel that shines too, and it wants the family. It uses such things as the ghosts of all those who have perished within it, and a horde of topiary creatures, to achieve its ends. To this end, the book suffers from Kings standard problems, which are the reason I have not given it the full 5 stars.He builds up the tension magnificently, and begins to reveal the plot bit by bit, and with consumate skill. But at the end, it all gets a little silly, with the topiary beasts coming to life and attacking people, and the bizarre ghost cocktail party that prompts Jack to go on the rampage, as the house tortures his mind to encouarge him to slay those he ultimately loves. It was also slightly predictable how it was going to end, with constant references to the boiler.

  Very dissapointed with the quality, bought as a present and was delivered next day which was excellent but once it was opened to read pages started to fall out and at least 40 of the pages have fallen out.
"
"
  I think this is the first horror book I ever read, and re-reading it recently I can see why it left such a lasting impression on me. A real chiller. It's ironic that Kubrick seems more closely associated with the words 'The Shining' nowadays, and he owes a debt of thanks to King. A new horror/mystery writer who has had a similar impact on me is Morton Bain.

  I read the Shining immedietely after reading 'IT'.The Shining is a lot shorter in comparison to 'IT' and I think I judged it unfairly because 'IT' was such a great novel.In hindsight, The Shining is a very well written horror.  It didn't grip me in the same way as 'IT' and I didn't fall in love with the characters as much, but the book still created plenty of vivid images, something Stephen King does so well.I especially liked the way Jack Torrance is not just a one dimensional character who suddenly goes mad and tries to murder his family in the isolated hotel his family have been assigned to look after over the winter.  The process into madness is gradual and you can feel him losing his grip on reality as the weeks go by and the hotel grips his mind more and more until it actually seems to come alive.The fact that Jack is also capable of violence before the hotel 'gets him', this makes the story a lot more believable and a lot scarier.I've seen the film version a couple of times and I'd say I like the novel more.  The reason is with the novel you can delve into the minds of the characters, you get to hear their thoughts and their sides to the argument.  It is quite scary the way Jack actually believes he is in the right in regards to his violence- King offers us both sides to each character and their motives, something a film version can never portray to the viwer.There are some generally scary moments in the novel, I won't ruin them but the Room 217 parts are genuinely horrifying. Basically Danny has seen the body of a long dead women in a bathtub.  Jack, still sane at this time, goes to check.  It's all about Jack being an unbelieving adult- ghosts simply don't exist...He enters the room and the shower curtain is drawn over- through the curtain he can see the shadow of what looks like a body in the bath.  Could it be Danny wasn't imagining the old lady?  Without looking and hardly believing his eyes, he goes to leave the room and hears clambering and what sounds like foot steps behind him- it's all about him not believing what is happening yet still running for his life, just in case he isn't hallucinating- genuinely scary and sends shivers up your back!!One thing I felt King could have done was reveal a bit more about Danny's imaginery friend, Tony.  He seems to explain who he is towards the end, but I think he could have done a bit more with this character.  But we can't have everything...:)All in all, a great book, well worth reading if you are a horror fan or just simply like a good story.  Defineteley worth the 4/5 stars.
"
"
  Like stated on the actual cover, I found this book impossible to put down and finished it within a few days. There's no one better than Stephen King at conveying slow-creeping dread. The plot and pace was good and the characters were all interesting and portrayed in sufficient detail to add further depth to the story. One of my favourite Stephen King novels, cannot wait to read Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  The book itself is great.  However, the book is very old (1980's) and the cover art isn't the one shown in the image I was shown when buying so it looks odd in my collection which bothers me. 2 stars for the buying experience. 5 stars for the actual literature.

  After having read Stephen King's 'THE STAND' I could not wait to get my hands on some of his other classic works. Before reading 'THE STAND' I had never been a huge fan of King's, I'd read a few of his books here and there but never any of the ones considered to be classics. So after reading 'THE STAND' I naturally decided to pick up 'THE SHINING' next. Having seen the Stanley Kubrick movie many, many years ago I felt a sense of de ja vu when starting this book which, unfortunately caused me to get off to a very slow start but once I got through the first hundred and fifty or so pages I was hooked.The story of the haunted Overlook Hotel is enough to scare any reader, especially if you read this book late at night, which I often did! But also the story of the Torrance family who the hotel's ghosts tore apart so handily is also heartbreaking and King deals with all of their thoughts and emotions very well here. While I do admit that there were parts of this book that dragged, overall it was a great reading experience, King can be a master story teller when he is on and he was definitely on when writing 'THE SHINING'. And if you are, like I was, worried that seeing the movie will ruin the book for you, I can assure you that the similarities are few and far between and the ending is completely different! So don't let that tiny detail deter you from reading this classic!
"
"
  They book is amazing, however turned up with many damaged pages. Some unreadable.. possibly just a bad batch with smudged ink?Books worth the read.
"
"
  I was really looking forward to reading this, my first Stephen King. A respected friend said it is much better than the film, more nuanced and with more plot and character development. Terrifying apparently. Ooh can't wait....!All I can say is that this book shows Kubrick to be a genius film maker who was able to make something truly scary out of something that reads like it was written by a creative writing student attempting to forge a style. It's just weak and irritating throughout in every element.I can't recommend this book to anyone but the terminally bored or those trying to overcome their fear of intimidating 'hedge lions'.

  Great film
"

  Rarely have five hundred small-fonted pages of a novel passed so fast.Before reading The Shining, I quite wrongly perceived Stephen King as as a pot-boiler par excellence - a turner-out of yearly novels for long enough that bookshop comfortably carry a whole shelves dedicated to his stuff, all spine-emblazoned with his name much larger than the book's title in ghoulish green or red; the time-honoured costume of the poolside horror. I once saw 
"
"
   as the only novel on sale at the airport bookshop in the Canaries and even then I didn't buy it.So I can't really explain how I came to pick up The Shining - I was looking for 
"
"
   and it had sold out. I had half-watched the 
"
"
   (fully watched now - reviewed elsewhere) but, were that any sort of guide, the story didn't warrant 500 pages of anything.So imagine my surprise.Though they bear superficial resemblances, King's novel is a quite different enterprise from Kubrick's film, and a far weightier thing than I was expecting: subtle, thoughtful, complexly plotted, richly characterised, figurative and crisply expressed. Kubrick's film is, well, a film: a piece of cinema where literary techniques developed for a written medium are, understandably, not at the forefront of the director's mind.Outwardly, the novel is a good old haunted house story but you don't need to scratch the surface terribly hard to see there's a lot more to it than that. Indeed, other than through the plot-functional device of ""Shining"" - King's premise requires the Torrances to be totally isolated, so there needs to be *some* way of calling for the cavalry - supernatural operating causes are mostly implied: there are *apparent* visions, sure, but (at least until the very end) these are experienced only by characters we know to be losing their minds. This is a psychiatric, and not psychic, horror. That to me, is a far more horrifying prospect. Hence the book's power.The motivations of the ultimate villain - assuming it is, as literally seems, the haunted house itself - are not explained or investigated. I think this verifies my suspicion that the house itself, like its boiler and interventionist hedgerows, is principally a metaphor, and the real source of horror is rooted in the strained relationship between Jack and Wendy, and Jack's own character flaws. A terrific read, unhesitatingly recommended.But if you wish to see the film, do that first. The book will spoil the film for you.Olly Buxton

  After reading this book for the first time (at least fifteen years ago), I'm sure I would have given it five stars. Today I'm giving it three. It's definitely not a bad book, and it's probably better than whatever Mr. King is writing these days, but I noticed when reading it this time that there was none of that old excitement I used to have when reading his work. He was basically my introduction to (private) literature, and for a long time he was at the top of my list. But since my tastes began to change and I came to appreciate ""serious"" literature, I have always wondered whether I would still like my old favorites, or if my judgment had just been poor at the time. Now I have my answer. This book is good and entertaining, but it's a long way from great, and it's certainly not a masterpiece, as it is stated to be on the cover. I remembered from the first time that the ending wasn't the same as in the movie, but I was a bit surprised to see just how much different the entire book was from the movie, which is almost impossible to keep out of one's head while reading this, since it was so well done, and is practically a landmark in movie history. I'm not going to mention what the differences are, but I think that if you haven't yet read this, and like the horror genre, it wouldn't be a bad place to start.

  I think I was lucky to have read The Shining before watching the film. While the film isn't bad by any means (it's excellent), the tone is completely different from that of the novel, which is more psychological and less stylised.Jack Torrance, a frustrated writer, assumes caretakership of The Overlook Hotel during its winter down-time, accompanied by his wife and son. He is made aware, during his interview with the hotel's manager, that The Overlook has been host to several gruesome murders in the past, not least of which was the previous caretaker's butchering of his entire family, but dismisses the stories and takes the job anyway, unaware of the effect that the hotel will have on his psychically-endowed son.Unlike the film (where Torrance seems to be insane long before he sets foot in the Overlook :), the novel describes a basically-ordinary man's descent into madness and is all the more compelling because of it. There are some genuinely frightening set pieces that aren't found in the movie (most notably the playground tunnel and the incredible hedge-animal sequence) where King manages to reach out of the page and give you the impression the somebody is standing right behind you - VERY few authors can create fear through the printed word alone. King has long been criticised for his endings, but The Shining's is satisfactorily closed (and, again, is different from the film). The hotel itself is also much more of a character, with its own malevalent agenda.If you have seen the film first, the novel will seem slow and lacking in impact, with Torrance not being as idiosyncratic as Nicholson's interpretation, but reading the book first will put the film in context.
"
"
  This book is my second favourite King novel, being surpassed by Different Seasons. The story has been immortalised in the famous Stanley Kubrick film the Shining, but once you read the book, you understand why King was upset about the film. The book features lots more things the film didn't include, including animals made from hedges which like to hurt people. The ending is completley different as well. It goes in such a different direction, you can't believe one was related to the other.This is a must read book. Stephen King really out does himself with this one.
"
"
  I bought The Shining so that I could re-read it before reading Dr Sleep. I had forgotten how scary it is, soooo much better than the film which is just too much Jack Nickleson. To be attacked by the person you love most in the world is everyone's worst fear and Mr King wrings every anguished emotion out of his characters. Brilliant
"
"
  As always, throughly enjoyed.
"
"
  Decided to re-read The Shining before tackling Doctor Sleep. My biggest worry was that I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I did first time round. No problem there. The Shining stands the test of time as a true horror classic. In fact, there's a good case for rating this as King's best. Great stuff. Now, on to Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  Patchy narrative but good cameos and invite into a child's mind. Unexplained meaning of hedge animals which were an unnecessary intrusion and distraction from the story. Got lost towards the end
"
"
  This is the first book I have read in a long time.  At first it looked a bit big with over 400 pages, but the story is fully absorbing and will have  you engrossed in minutes.  It takes time for the plot to thicken, but after  a while it can be seen that the 'Outlook' hotel has an evil presence.  Jack, Wendy and little Danny are trapped, snowed in with disturbing things  happening.  I have talked to a friend who has seen the film, but lots of  the book is cut out.  Make sure this is the book you read, preferably  before the film.
"

  As with most people I saw the film for this a number of years ago when I was a kid (probably hidden behind a pillow)Decided after many years that I would read the book, my first thoughts were that it could never stand up to the film and I kind of expected a mediocre read.....Boy was I wrong.... for a start there is a lot more going on in the book and King slowly builds up to each creepy moment like a cat starting to pounce. Although the concept of the film and book are the same, I would advise anyone to read the book as it has so much more to offer. The character's past is explained in depth with allows the reader empathise with the situations they find themselves in, and the reasons the hotel affects each one differently. This is another of those books where the film appears very very inferior. All that said, I have awarded the book 4 stars, not five.... due mainly to the fact that a number of times I kept wishing that it would fly onto the next chilling bit and not keep delving into the past events. I think that much of the background information was needed, just not maybe in the order the author set it out..... if that makes sense.....All in all a very enjoyable read and the 500 pages flew by. Very often I am put off reading a book if I have seen the film as I already know the ending.... not this time though.... the ending is quite a lot different, and somehow more final.One last word before I go...  REDRUM!!!!!

  Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy, and their son Danny check in to the Overlook Hotel in remote Colorado--sort of.  Jack, who struggles to be a writer and struggles not to be a drunk, has signed them up to be a caretaker family during the hotel's winter off-season.  The Torrances will be alone, isolated by distance, then cut off by snow.  Jack works away at his novel.  Wendy and Danny explore the empty hotel.The hotel is empty, but not abandoned.  It ""shines"" with the residue of past evil.  Dick Hallorann, the hotel's cook, explains this phenomenon to Danny before departing for the season.  Recognizing that they share a psychic ability to see more than others, Dick tells Danny to ignore what he sees.  It cannot harm him.  While the hotel cannot harm Danny directly, it can work through others.  As the book progresses, the hotel's evil takes gradual possession of Jack, releasing a homicidal rage that Wendy and Danny slowly recognize then desperately try to escape.This story will give you a lasting scare.  While you deal with this, savor two accompanying themes.  The first is a strong sense of history and place.  You get to know the Overlook Hotel in terms of what has happened there and as an ordinary hotel with rooms, a kitchen, ballroom, storerooms, and all of its other parts.  You will wonder how a place designed to meet its guests' daily needs can possess such a hidden hunger for their souls.  The well-written contrast between the ordinary and supernatural is part of the book's tension.The second theme is the book's illustration of the nature of evil.  Jack could not have been possessed by the hotel had he not taken willing steps toward it.  In a key scene, Jack enters the formerly empty hotel bar to find it fully stocked and tended by a former caretaker, now deceased.  Jack is slowly instructed in what he must do as a drink is prepared and set before him.  Weakened by his alcoholism, Jack takes this first drink, tacitly agreeing to destroy his family and giving the hotel greater power over him.  This ""entice, agree, enslave"" sequence repeats several times as Jack slips into madness.It all works out.  Leaving the reader thoroughly frightened and impressed.  Read this Stephen King classic first, and then see

   is also interesting, but not as moving as either of the first two.

  This novel has definitely stood the test of time. Save for a few 70s references, the story could be taking place in a hotel in 2013.. I would recommend both this novel and the sequel Dr Sleep. Stephen King weaves his scary magic once again.
"
"
  Excellent book - different to the film so don't worry if you have seen the film first. Just pretend that the book uses the same characters but it's a different story. This book is so much more.
"
"
  This story has depth, horror, and emotion. It's a brilliant story of a family meltdown, and well worth reading.
"
"
  I must of read The Shining originally 20/25 years ago. Still has the scare factor, still gives me the heebie jeebies!Really appreciate the psychological aspects of the book now, which makes a lot scarier then reading it when I was just out of my teens.
"
"
  Deeply chilling and disturbing, an incredible book that drags the reader deep into the situation and pysche of the characters involved. Stephen King perfectly manages to balance the supernatural presence of the Outlook hotel matched with the delicate psychological mind of Jack Torrence.Unable to put it down until I finished the last page, I enjoyed every second and thoroughly believed the amount of detail and imagery created.A Must read

  Nowadays it seems that the movie version of this story from the Master of Horror Stephen King is more famous than this, the original novel. I like many others saw the film before I read the book. I actually watched the film as a child and remember being scared to go into the bathroom for fear of encountering the 217 woman for quite some time! In fact the book is actually quite different from the film and that's good because it gives a new version of events to what happened at the Overlook Hotel. So, the story starts with recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance being interviewed for the position of caretaker for the prestigious Overlook Hotel during it's winter season, when the hotel is closed and snowed in for months on end. We follow Jack as he moves his wife, Wendy, and son Danny into the hotel in hopes of forming a closer family bond and writing the play he's been working on. But Jack doesn't realize that his son has 'The Shine', an ability to read other's thoughts and see things that most people can not. Before that winter Danny's talent had'nt been too much of a problem but the Overlook has a lot of secrets and a sordid past and while snowed in Danny has no escape from these visions.This is a truly harrowing story, it develops a creeping horror that will stick in the back of your mind long after the last page is turned. It's a modern classic and rightly so.

  To be honest, i had never read a King book in my life before i read The Shining. i had no idea what to expect. a lot of people i know have seen the film based on this book and said it was good so i thought: why not read the book?i have to admit the beginning didn't really grab me. i'm a person that gets easily distracted though so that may have been why but when stuff started to happen in the hotel, i couldn't put it down! i was glued to this book! King has got everything just right in this book. The horror is more of a subtle nature at first, leaving you to think the characters may have just imagined these abnormal events and then as the novel progresses so does the level of noticeable abnormality.I was a person who didn't believe in the whole 'books are scary' kind of thing because it's been said i 'lack an imagination'! but after reading this, i feel different towards this view! i wouldn't go in a bathroom for the next month without turning the light on before i'd go in!!So, yeah, i'd take a chance and buy this book if i was you. i'm not exactly known for being a fan of reading or whatever, but i loved this book! and seeing as they're so cheap on here it would be silly not too! :)i hope this helped!

  Twenty-seven years after its publication, The Shining remains a visceral, gripping read that showcases Stephen King's unfathomable powers to hypnotize and terrify readers, a power King had in abundance in the early stages of his career.  Coming on the heels of Carrie and 'Salem's Lot, The Shining truly established King as a modern master of horror and an unequalled purveyor of a literary mirror into pop culture.  If you've only seen the original movie starring Jack Nicholson, you really owe it to yourself to read the novel; Stanley Kubrick made a fine and scary movie, but he did not capture the essence of King's story, and his dramatization followed a different path than what you find in the original vision brought to life through the words of King.  The more recent miniseries was more faithful to the novel, but it doesn't take an Einstein to figure out that a made-for-TV dramatization is limited in terms of what it can get away with in a number of important areas.  Simply put, The Shining stands just behind Shirley Jackson's The House on Haunted Hill as one of the best ""haunted house"" novels ever written.The plot should be quite familiar to one and all by this point.  The Torrance family embarks on a months-long retreat into complete isolation when Jack Torrance signs on to be the winter custodian of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado.  Jack takes some personal demons with him to a hotel chock-full of malevolent, ghostly spirits; he is a recovering alcoholic who, in the last couple of years, lost his job and broke his little boy's arm in a state of drunken fury.  He thinks the months alone with his wife and son will allow him to find peace - and to finally finish the play he has been working on.  His long-suffering wife has some misgivings, but the only person really clued into the dreadful possibilities is his son Danny.  Danny has ""the shine,"" a gift which allows him to see and know things he cannot possibly know; it is a powerful gift which the Overlook (which really is an entity unto itself) jealously desires for itself.As the days pass, the Overlook exerts more and more of an influence on Jack, exploiting his weaknesses, exacerbating his paranoia and persecution complex, and basically turning him into a murderous new tool at the hotel's disposal.  Danny sees what is happening, although he cannot really understand much of it given his very young age.  He can certainly understand the terror of the Overlook, however, as he sees images of the hotel's murderous past and very dark near future in a number of unsettling scenes interspersed throughout the novel.  This is a harrowing tale of survival against incredible odds of a supernatural nature, and King brings every nuance of the story to vivid life, capturing perfectly the internalization and externalization of fear among exceedingly real, believable characters that the reader gets to know very well indeed.  As has always been the case with Stephen King, it is his incomparable powers of characterization that make the supernatural elements of his story work so amazingly well.  You can't help but be emotionally committed to these characters.The Shining really isn't one of my all-time favorite Stephen King novels, but it is exceedingly well crafted and features some of the most harrowing scenes to be found in King's immense body of work.  Even though I had read the novel before and was quite familiar with the story in both its literary and cinematic manifestations, I was completely caught up in the story as I re-read it - to the point that I found myself flipping the pages faster than I normally do for a novel completely new to me.  When you talk about the seminal works of modern horror, you have to talk about The Shining - it's just that good a read.

  First of all, as a casual read this will keep you hooked until the end. I find that King drives most of his hooks from the characters. In this novel, Jack Torrance is the really interesting one. The backtracking into a life filled with sex, drugs and rock n' roll provides a realistic insight into a loving father that is persuaded and eventually consumed by the hotel. Danny's premonitions are also uniquely handled in the form of a psychokinetic ability known as ""the shining."" However Wendy is a mere tag along, an archetype that ""just loves her son"" - we don't really have much character development and we, as an audience become annoyed with her presence really.The usual flaw with a King novel is 90% development and 10% action at the end. The Shining is no exception, there is a huge build up to a fairly obvious conclusion, sometimes the novel feels saggy and weighty - sometimes King uses three pages where one would suffice. However this part of King's work is like marmite, we fans love it whereas some people absolutely loathe it. I like the backstory but I can understand it as a floor in what should be a super-gripping horror story.Great book and a must read for any horror fan.

  If like me before I'd read this book you've only seen the film, or even only absorbed those clips and parodies of the film that have seeped into every day usage then it's worth checking out the source material.I can't stress strongly enough that the book is not the film. They may contain the same essential elements but they are different stories.The film is really about the descent of a man into a kind of madness, a cabin fever brought on by boredom and isolation in which some spooky things happen but they may just be in his mind. The book is the story of a place, a place where powerful and malevolent forces have infiltrated the fabric of the hotel that's built there and manifest themselves in increasingly disturbing ways.I wasn't gripped straight away. It took maybe 50-100 pages. But during the early part of the book I identified - too much for comfort - with the character of Jack Torrance and that kept me interested. Once we get to the hotel, the tension ratchets up increasingly as the chapters go by and by the end it's a really suspenseful page-turning thrill of a ride.

  Just finished this last night. I have been a Stephen King fan for years but have stayed away from The Shining due to the fact I am extremely familiar with the film (a true classic that transcends the horror genre), and I find that reading a novel AFTER seeing the film adaptation stops me being fully absorbed in the narrative (even with this book I still couldn't get Jack Nicholsons' face out of my head).Having said that, however, this is a great book.I found it genuinely spooky, particularly the bits with the 'woman in the tub', and the crux of the matter is that King tells a cracking story, despite the fact his prose can be at times stilted and slightly childish. It is the story that kept me going and I thought that all the characters in the book were well drawn and the family realtionships between them all put it slightly above standard horror fare. I also totally agree with what King says in his introduction about Jack being much more than just a 'bogeyman', and that is why I think the movie fails to deliver story-wise and character-wise in the same way that the book does.Highly recommended.

  I really enjoyed the book but it just fell a little flat towards the end. You are on the edge of your seat from the very beginning. Not normally a fan of this genre but will be reading more King for sure.

  So I re-read The Shining over this  weekend (21st/22nd Sept 2013)  in preparation for Dr Sleep - the sequel - which landed on my doorstep on Saturday morning, all shining (pun intentional)  and new. Reading The Shining first seemed appropriate and was like having the best homework assignment ever!Danny was only five years old but in the words of old Mr Halloran he was a `shiner', aglow with psychic voltage. When his father became caretaker of the Overlook Hotel his visions grew frighteningly out of control.Do you know I adore Stephen King novels and yet I hate reviewing them - why? Because each time I just want to yell ""Its brilliant damn it, its King. Just read the darn thing you don't need to know anymore!"". In fact the temptation to leave it at that and just go and dive headlong into the next part of Danny's story is a burning need right down in my reading soul right now but hey, I'll squash that and do my best...Stephen King. Words are his Power. Yes they really are - now I'm aware that he is not universally loved, and even many of his constant readers have been disappointed in his later novels, but that isnt the case for me. They have all held me captive for the entire reading experience. Yes, even the much maligned ""Cell"".  The Shining of course, is an older release and generally well loved by fans of Mr King, so for them I can't say anything they don't already know...For those of you who have not yet dipped a toe into the weird and wonderful world of King, this may well be a good place to start. It is one of his better novels (yes even me, unapologetic fangirl that I am, will say that some of his books are better than others). Its a haunting tale - haunting because Danny is haunted and he is just a child. A child who will have to grow up before his time and understand what he is seeing, feeling and hearing, in order to survive whats coming...The creeping sense of menace that pervades the pages of ""The Shining"" starts immediately. Mr King does not molly coddle his audience - despite the rather mundane situation Danny is in when we first meet him (sitting on a kerb, waiting for his Dad to return from a job interview) we immediately become aware that he is different..not your average 5 year old boy. Oh no indeed.I expect you have all seen the film. Jack Nicholson rocked that movie, but it wasnt The Shining. Not really - not for me. The Shining is a tense, creeping, emotional tale that grabs you by the throat and will not let go....the sudden ""shocks"" of the horror movie version will not happen here...but slowly and surely you will feel more and more nervous. Hedge animals. Aaargh! I'm hiding. No really I am....keep that axe proof duvet handy...The Overlook Hotel sneaks up on you...what it hides behind its facade would affect the most mentally stable of people and Jack Torrance, Danny's father, could never be described as such. As he descends further into the mire, the sense of apprehension is tangible...clever clever writing.So I loved it. No surprise there. This must be the fourth or fifth time I have read it and its still as terrific as ever and still compels me to read every word and not skip a thing. Ok. Thats the best I can do. I hope it helps. Now...Doctor Sleep is calling....Happy Reading Folks!

  A Must read for any Reader of fiction or Fan of Horror!Great in depth characters and fascinating story of a family tore apart at the Overlook Hotel.
"

  Absolutely superb. This is a great novel and a must read from Stephen King. The book is far superior to the film and the action and terror is created from King putting a young family into a claustrophobic and creepy setting. You feel great affection and sympathy for Danny and Wendy Torrance. You are also disturbed by a father's descent into madness and how much the Overlook hotel (and the ghosts within it) are responsible for this breakdown. The atmosphere in the novel is chilling and the psychic link between the boy and Dick Halloran is well written and convincing. I love this book and it is a must read. Stephen King is a great writer and deserves a lot more respect from the literary establishment. This novel is deserving to be on the list of most reads before you die.5 stars

  How does the guy make such outrageous horrors believable?  Inch by inch, he removes your sense of reality.  He isolates you, then he normalizes you, then he plays this psychopathic croquet (sorry, 'roque') game while you watch helpless - unable to help these characters you've come to know.All good horror makes the unbelievable seem real, but King has this way of slipping inside your skull - of pulling out primal fears (like the fear of wasps, or the childish fear that someone may be watching you in the dark) and using them to terrorize his readers.The narrative mix between alcoholic father, abused mother and strongly psychic child is compelling, and so convincing you can't help but think a child WOULD be like that if they were able to hear the thoughts of their seniors.Now I'm not just writing this because it's Stephen King.  We all know he's good, and surely even he'd agree with that after a career longer than my lifespan.  But, like all good classics, this novel has a timeless quality that most authors will never achieve.  The Overlook continues to haunt generations of people more than 30 years after its conception, and long may it continue to do so.

  Love an interesting book.

  I committed the cardinal sin of watching the Shining film several times without actually reading the book. I am a great fan of the Stanley Kubrick's film the Shining, and also a fan of Jack Nicholson.But as an author myself and a fan of many of Stephen King's stories, I eventually came to reading the Shining book rather a long time after it was written.The book has certainly lost none of its appeal. It presents the Overlook Hotel, not just as a collection of walls and rooms but as a living entity. The rich history of the hotel provides a fantastic setting for the main characters to unfold.The original story is quite different from the the films that followed, perhaps explaining Stephen's apparent dislike of them. Although the setting is the same, the films have ignored large sections of the book and added many sections that aren't present in the book. This is probably an ongoing friction between authors and screen-writers. The latter is 'based on' the former but veers off where it pleases.But the book is a highly entertaining read, frightening in places and very good at leaving the reader in a sort of tense apprehensive state, wondering what will happen next. The characters were good and the story was strong. The setting adds great atmosphere and the book shows the early talent of King as it was just being unfolded many years ago. Since then he has learnt many new tricks and produced story after story becoming one of the most prolific story writers of out time.I'm not sure what Stephen thinks when he looks back at his early work, no doubt there will be bits here and there he wouldn't do the same way with hindsight, but this book still stands out as a great story even many years  after it was first written. No doubt it'll be here for many years to come also.At the start of the book there is a new introduction where Stephen describes how the book came about and what it meant to him at the time. It was a turning point in his career where he could have played safe but went the extra mile to take risks and produce a story that is greater than the sum of its parts.I highly recommend this book to any reader, not just horror fans.Shine on. Shine on.

  Oh deary me, how dreadful this novel is. Classic? You've got to be kidding! It's so overwritten it could easily have been half the length. King repeats himself over and over (“Jack rubbed his mouth” appears almost on every page – okay...I get it...he's a recovering alcoholic!) and lets the story wander all over the place before FINALLY finding a semi-workable groove towards the last act.If you are a fan of the movie I would suggest that you do not read this book. While Kubrick's movie was spare and alienated the novel is s-l-o-w and heavy and takes ages and ages to go anywhere. How anyone can find this trash scary is beyond me. Killer hedge animals? Really? KILLER HEDGE ANIMALS???If this is classic King then count me out for reading anything else in his bibliography. The only thing this brick of a book is good for is straightening-out a table with a short leg. Biggest waste of 50p I ever spent.

  One of those brilliant books that i will always remember. Those books that poke at so many emotions and leave you wishing there was more.This is the second SK book i have read, and it blew me away. Currently classified as 'Horror', and i agree, But i think it is more of a 'Horror/tragedy'.The scenes in the last few pages threatened to make me cry whilst i was amongst my family on holiday, and that is quite a feat.Jack Torrance is officially my favorite character. If you have watched the Stanley Kubrick (i think thats the name) movie version of the book, then you have seen nothing at all of the books potential. The book is heart wrenching, aswell as freaky, disturbing, and scary as SH!*The TV mini series version of the book is very close to the book but still not as good. I think it is a google-zillion times better than the Kubrick version, because it attempts to focus more on the tragedy, as opposed to the horror.Focusing more on SK usuall horror/thriller writing, i must say this is also... no actually. it is probably the FIRST and ONLY book i have read so far in my life that really did freak me out.I am a fan of horror films, i watch them alot, and the gore and blood doesnt bother me as much as it should. SK's work however, made my skin crawl. The way he has written it, described it, gives a whole new level of horror that films just cant capture.The part where Jack Torrance goes to check on room 217. I dont know how much i can say without spoiling it, but i gotta' say the part where he sees something in the bath-tub through the curtain. And the way the door knob rattles whilst hes trying to lock the door. *Shivers*All in all- Masterpiece. A MUST read. A perfect book that does what you expect, and a hell of alot more. Please read this, you just HAVE to understand how good it is!:(

  I first read this novel when I was fifteen years old. It was also the first Stephen King novel I ever read. I came back to this book to re-read it as a twenty-seven year old excited and convinced I would gain more from the book as an adult. And I was right. What was simply a horror story about a haunted hotel when I was a teenager became much more as an adult. The horror was still there but so was the haunting psychological terror of the ghosts of our pasts invading our presents, the torture of memories we think we can escape and the people we hope we'll never become.Danny Torrence is five years old. He knows things that no child should have access to. He knows his parents were considering Divorce, that his father has a drink problem. And he knows that there's something horrifying behind the beautiful facade of The Overlook Hotel. Danny's father, Jack has got a job as winter caretaker of The Overlook. He needs this job - his last one didn't end so well - plus the distance from the real world will give him plenty of time to finish the play he's been working on. And so he packs up his wife and kid and drives high up into the Colorado mountains where once the snow comes, there's no going back. They will be stuck there until the snows thaw.But five year old Danny has the 'shining', a rare ability to sense things, to read minds, to see the dark images that play out in The Overlook. His vivid dreams and psychic trances reveal the dark secrets The Overlook has kept hidden for decades. Who is the creepy dead woman in Room 217? What is that blood stain on the wall of the presidential suite? Who is riding up and down in the elevator at night? And just how do those topiary animals move around on their own?'The Shining' is a chilling read, not overtly scary but it definitely raises the hairs on your arms. It has much more substance than most horror novels out there and really defines Stephen King as the forerunner of the genre.

  I've never read Stephen King before, so I'm guessing this is impartial really....I bought this because it seemed to be his best rated work, and apparently very scary......I have to admit I found it to be neither...I personally didn't find one section of this book scary at all, and after reading the Amityville horror by J Anson ( which was very scary), I have to admit I was left very disappointed, so much that I had to make myself finish the book.I have to admit however that the last quarter of the book is by far the best bit, it had me engrossed at that point, but was it worth the rest of the time, I feel it probably wasn't.The one thing I must add is that I did put the film on, as I hadn't seen it in years, and I had to turn it off, as the book was better at least that the movie.
"
"
  In all the books I've read in my time, 'The Shining' has to be rated as the best. The combination of Stephen King's literary superiority and horrifying imagination produce a scarily good result.In The Shining we follow Jack Torrance who takes over as caretaker of the Overlook hotel for the winter, where only he and his family will stay as blizzards enclose the hotel. But his son, Danny is having strange visions, and the hotel itself is eerily odd.From the story we learn about Danny, and his nightmarish visions, but the novel begins to get really scary when his father Jack, who doesn't have any psychic ability, starts seeing things too. I used to read this book at night before going to sleep, and after I'd put down the book and turned out the light, my heart would continue to pound in my chest...such is the quality of the suspense and horror.But don't be fooled by the movie version with Jack Nicholson. Despite Nicholson's fantastic performance as Torrance, the movie is a gross miscarriage of the book, and omits 70% of the book's story. The famous 'Here's Johnny' line isn't even in the book...it's just in the film.Above all else, you must read this book, even if you've seen the film. But be warned...once you have reached the part where Torrance enters room 217...is the part where things really start to get scary.

  much better detail and backcgrond in the novel than the film

  Wow absolutely incredible book, definitely one of his best I've read so far would highly recommend.

  Extremely well read adding atmosphere to Stephen kings work. Very good

  I thought this story was really scary and atmospheric.  It had me on the edge of my seat frequently.  It is a gripping story which holds your attention until the final page.

  I loved 'The Shining' and it was my first Stephen King novel. I thought that it was written well and I enjoyed the little inserts that King uses to allude to points already made. However, with regards to 'The Shining', I found that King did not explore his characters far enough especially in the case of Wendy Torrance, Danny's mother. I felt like she lacked a dimension and her part in the plot did not really surface until the end of the novel. That would be my only critism of the novel and since reading 'The Shining' I have become hooked on Stephen King.
"
"
  In one word, this is the BEST book ever in the whole universe. Some chapters are boring-but they lead onto brilliant addictive chapters packed full of horror and excitement. Stephen King obviously worked hard on it and it came out THE BEST he has ever written. You haven't been truly horrified if you haven't read this!!
"
"
  This was my first ever horror novel, and it definitely lived up to the classic status that it has.
"
"
  First of all - before I properly begin - allow me to say that this review is not a comparison between the novel The Shining by Stephen King and the film adaptation by Stanley Kubrick. Also, please note that there are likely be some minor spoilers regarding both works; and while I do not think that every single person who considers reading this book does so due to seeing cinematic adaption, I would surmise that a great deal are indeed introduced to the book through the film. Anyway, on to the review itself.The relevance of review title is from my own experience; seeing the film (numerous times) before ever reading the book. However, after having read the book recently, my opinion of the film has somewhat diminished.Yes, Kubrick's version (and vision) is one in its own right, and yes, it is very different to the source material. However, this - I think - is what makes the book that much more eerie.The film focuses on Jack and his descent into madness, as if by mental illness; whereas the book focuses much more on the Hotel itself and the happenings there over the years.To be sure, the book is quite creepy; the concept of 'the shining' being a case in point. As well as this, the way the Overlook Hotel 'comes to life' gradually is also very disturbing.The characters in the book, even the 5-year-old 'main' character, Danny, have a lot of depth and the reader is provided with a great deal of insight into their thoughts - all relative to their own feelings and individual perspectives.While I haven't read a great deal of Stephen King books, I would probably say that this is one of the better ones I have read; it is very well written in his signature style (even though it is only King's third published novel, his distinctive narrative soon becomes apparent), and definitely one of his more horror-oriented works.I must say I thoroughly enjoyed The Shining, and would recommend it to anybody who is a fan of King (or H.P. Lovecraft - if you read the book you will see what I mean). I would also invite fans of Stanley Kubrick's film to read this book - but not to sully their opinion of the movie, as mine was, considerably - but for two reasons:First, to see just how different King's Shining is from Kubrick's; but please, do not be disdained by the nuances between book and film - I assure you, the book is greatly superior. Second, I encourage any fan of the film to read an excellent horror novel that is atmospheric and compelling; a disturbing and fulfilling story of the supernatural intertwined with something that is all too human.

  I have owned The Shining by Stephen King for a long time and it has been sitting on my shelf picking up dust and unread. I knew it was a novel which I would most definately enjoy but was too occupied with other things in life.I recently decided that I felt like reading something so without a doubt I picked this up and started reading it to fully appreciate Stephen King's novel. I've seen Stanley Kubrick's movie adaptation before the reading the novel, so I was imagining the characters and settings in my brain as I'd seen them in the movie; and this isn't necessarily a bad thing.I found the book to be a classic page turner and as I was reading the entire book, I didn't keep any consciousness of time, how many pages I've read or how many pages were left to read. This is due to me being completely absorbed in the story and enjoying it immensely. Stephen King is a very detailed and thorough author in his vocabulary and explanations of every minor detail so I frequently came across phrases which I didn't fully understand the meaning of. I had an Oxford dictionary accompanying me as I read through the book so I can reference words up to get a fuller understanding of the novel. This in itself shows how much I loved the book and wanted to fully absorb its contents and understand everything that was going on.I felt an emotional attach and love for most of the characters in the novel including Dick Halloran and could feel what they were going through. I must admit that I didn't find the novel very scary but that is just me. I did find it creepy and very atmospheric with a lot of tension building up. I love the way Stephen King explains some events in the story whether it be past, present or future and it sometimes made me grimace involuntarily because of its grotesqueness.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves horror fiction or Stephen King and I think it is so good, I think I can foresee a future when I pick this book up off my shelf for a second time and read it again.

  The incredibly prolific King delivered here his most famous and fondly remembered work of fiction and it is a work of genius. It doesn't quite match the grandiose and frankly stunning ""IT"" but is close. A huge number of themes are connected in a very tight plot and the characters are as complex and memorable as ever. Reading this makes the totally depressing film even worse, since a vast number of the most interesting themes in the book were jettisoned for the adaptation. Dumbfoundingly great.

  When it comes to storytelling Stephen King is one of the best in the business. By the time you're about thirty pages into one of his books he has usually got you hooked: the intriguing premise has been set up; the uneasy atmosphere created; the all too human characters described and then, before you know it, you're a couple of hundred pages through the novel and all hell is breaking loose. The Shining is a particularly fine example of early King. After Carrie and 'Salem's Lot - both decent novels - King really hits his stride and adds depth to his abilities as a pure weaver of tales. The reason The Shining works so well is because the characters, and in particular Jack Torrance, have so much depth. Torrance, on the one hand, is a violent, drink-addled monster who once broke his son's arm in a rage. On the other he's a guy who grew up with an abusive father, loves his wife, tries and fails to cope with the lousy hand fate has dealt him and manages to fight his alcohol addiction with great success. And then he gets the job as winter caretaker of the Overlook hotel and fate, once again, deals him a bum hand of low numbers and mixed suits. The Overlook, as luck would have it, is up there with Shirley Jackson's Hill House when it comes to an ability to tease and unravel a fragile mind.King deliberately keeps the set-up for The Shining very simple: take three characters - Jack, his wife Wendy and their son Danny - place them in an isolated location and then tighten the screws. Add to this the concept of the shining itself - Danny has the ability to read minds and can tap in to lingering psychic presences (the unpleasant past events from Room 217 for example) - and you're all set for an excellent supernatural thriller. King is terrific when it comes to those seemingly throw-away details which genuinely take you by surprise: topiary animals that seem to move; voices from empty rooms; Torrance's increasingly skewed perception of reality as his mind dissolves in the Overlook's haunting isolation. It's Edgar Allan Poe, Henry James and Shirley Jackson all rolled into one and the result is one of the finest supernatural novels ever put down on paper. It's great stuff and an absolutely brilliant and thrilling read. Perfect for autumn, as the nights draw in and the snow begins to fall.

  You remember that scene in Friends, where Joey is so scared of The Shining that he hid it in the freezer? I’m not entirely sure what scared him so much. It’s suspenseful, for sure, but that also means that there are long periods in which nothing much seems to happen. I was left with the feeling that big chunks of it could be removed without a problem, leaving it as a better book – then again, I guess that’s kind of what they did with the film.There are a few things in the book that don’t get a mention in the movie, and there are also a few subtle differences including a strikingly different ending – unfortunately, though, I still prefer the movie, and I’m not exactly a massive fan of it. I just enjoy it as much as the next person.The problem is, I can’t put my finger on what the problem is – there’s nothing inherently wrong with the story or with King’s writing, I just didn’t really think the book lived up to the hype. Perhaps you’ll have a different point of view, but I regret reading this before any other Stephen King book because it put me off him. Then I tried The Green Mile a couple of years later and was instantly converted.In fact, I much preferred The Shining’s sequel, Doctor Sleep, which follows the story of the now grown-up Danny. There was more menace behind that, perhaps because King had a long period of time between the two books with which to perfect his craft. That said, you’d still need to read the first book before reading the sequel if you wanted to get the most out of it. And I highly recommend reading the sequel, so I suppose you’re just going to have to grit your teeth and get ready to read it.So if you still want to go ahead and read The Shining then do it, but prepare to bed yourself in for a couple of weeks because it’s a long old read, and not something that you can just casually approach. If you don’t psyche yourself up for it beforehand, you’ll probably give up a third of the way in and go off and read something else instead. If you’re wondering how I know, it’s because that’s exactly what I did when I first read it.

  With Stephen King being the genius that he is, I wanted to like this book so badly. I hadnt seen the film prior to reading this so I went in totally blinde. I kind of got the gist of the story.  Jack moves his wife and child to a huge hotel in the mountains for the winter season as he had managed to land a job as caretaker whilst the season was out. Times were hard financially so despite the hotels colorful history, this was their only option. Their son, Danny has a gift - ""the shine"". He sees what others do not.I want to start off by saying I was bitterly disappointed with the lack of ""scares"" and the shocking way this was written. What a confusing, hard to follow book! Unfortunately, this lost me when the hotels animal shaped hedges started coming to life. I wanted to like this. I wanted to take this seriously. The idea was fantastic - perhaps the film is worth a try.
"
"
  I read this book after a 10 year gap and it is still brilliant, particularly the build up as the hotel literally becomes alive with evil.
"
"
  This is the second time I am reading this book and it is still as gripping as the first time.  An excellent read.
"
"
  Amazon need to sort their pages out. on the top 100 list this book is priced at #1.49, yet when I went to buy it, the price on the page says #5.98 - so which is it, as at the 1.49, mark I wanted to buy it!Since I've been criticised for 1*ing this review it was not a reflection on the legend that is Stephen King.. It was just a note on the pricing system by amazon as at the time I didn't know that it was a Daily Deal,  maybe when a books in the chart at a one day reduced rate just have (daily deal) written next to the price. Is that too much to ask?So although this is a 1* review of sorts; I've 5*'d it just for the book itself.
"
"
  As you would expect from Stephen king good solid storyline. Read it as I've just bought the new doctor sleep
"
"
  This is the second time i read this and I seem to love it more and more each time. Wonderfully written, full of heart and terror.Would recomend this if you are after tence horror and characters that are so lifelike you'd think you know them.
"
"
  Great book
"

  This is an almighty concoction of horror, suspense, disbelief, supernatural and downright insane! The Stanley Kubrick adaptation was one of my all time favorite movies. When one of my friends said to me ""you should read the book. It's far, far better"" it's safe to say i was dubious! But when i did get around to buying and reading it (stanley, how could you leave out jack and danny's visit to the topiary!!!?) the film seemed to grey into the backround. i've read this book four times now and it's safe to say it gets scarier every read just simply because you pick up on different things. Knuckle-whiteningly scary!! a true masterpiece.
"
"
  So, I'd seen the film - well all apart from one very important scene, it turns out - and I must admit, I didn't really get it.  My father told me .. ""read the book"", so I did.  I thought it would be something interesting to read on the train to work. It was one of the best books I have ever read, however, I must confess that it scared the life out of me!There were times when I alarmed passengers on my train with gasps, there were times when I had to just close the book for a minute and regain my composure and I must confess that the book did go into the freezer on more than one occasion.The book has so much more detail than the film and it all made much more sense.  The ending in the book is different to the film and although seeing the film helped me visualise the hotel, etc, the book is a million times better.  However, Jack Torrence will always be Jack Nicholson to me and I check the bath tub every night before I go to bed ... even now, a year after reading the book ... THAT was the very important scene from the film that I missed.  The part of the book that described that scene will, I think, stay with me for many years to come.I'd like to read the book again, but I don't think my nerves could stand it.Read it ... you'll be scared ... but it will be one of the best books you ever read.

  The Shining #1“The Shining” is the story of Jack Torrance, who is employed as the caretaker of the gargantuan Overlook Hotel in Colorado one winter. With his wife and son they hoped to spend the winter season in peace and stitch up their fractured family.The book was first released in 1977 then made into a movie starring Jack Nicholson, just the best choice to play the main character here. I haven’t seen the movie but in the book Mr. King goes to great pains to show Jack as a good man that is simply pushed into fantasy or hallucination. Because I received its sequel “Doctor Sleep” as a gift I needed to know how this horror all started.For 416 pages, the tense and atmospheric story centers on the family saga. Their encounters with apparitions are very visual, leaving a picture in the mind that may be scary for some and totally ridicule for others. Not only it is a very dark story, with every turn of the page things get worse and worse in the haunted resort, it also borders on the fantastical with plenty of over the top scenes rife with violence and supernatural. For some, Mr. King may be a master entertainer no matter how ridiculous his tales are or how frightening they may be, well perhaps for them but this horror did not gel with me, I simply had trouble getting through this mess. The author gets so bogged down in tedious descriptions and exposition, the story is so overwritten I fast lost interest. Don’t forget, pay attention, not only does the narration rotates between the three members of the Torrance family it is also taken over by many other characters, some human and some not so human.I didn’t think this book was scary at all despite the considerably large cast of ghosts and creepy critters and the great amount of violence at every page. This is a tedious read, it just drags on and on, so stubborn was I nevertheless made it to the end even if I was bored to death…..evidently not my type of book.
"
"
  Absolutely loved this book, a real hard-to-put-down affair!I wont go into too much detail as everyone else already has, the story is very different to the film, infact, despite the mighty Stanley Kubric working his magic, its still a bastardisation of the book... its pacey, engaging and draws you in like a spider web... JUST READ IT! you wont be disappointed
"
"
  I loved the film, ""The Shining"", but I have to say that the book is better.  The two are completely different with the book have more meaning behind it that the film.  There are some brilliant scenes in the book though that transferred beautifully to the cinema, including my favourite scene with Grady [""You've always been the caretaker, Mr. Torrence.... and I should know... I've always been here""].  At 500 pages, it is just about the right length.  There are very few dull parts in this book and, of course, it'll scare you!THE RED DEATH HELD SWAY OVER ALL
"
"
  I re-read this for the first time in years recently, and I'd forgotten how good it is. Terrifying in places, great characters, you sort of side with Jack from time to time, and even Wendy isn't as annoying as in the film. A must read.
"
"
  I really liked this book,it is much better then the stanley kubrick version.Much more indepth and scary i thought!It was definitively another page turner for me!The part in it when the topiary animals come alive!
"
"
  I have tried to find out if books can give you the same feeling of fear like when watching scary movies. Apparently I have a very vivid imagination, because this book really scared me. First I was very sceptical because I feel Stephen King is selling books more because of his name, and not because of his talent. I would love to see one of his books where his name is not covering 50 % of the front cover, making only small room for the title. Plus, I had previously tried reading Misery (which I did not even finish) and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and was not very impressed.However, this book scared me so much and that is why I love it so much. Especially one particular scene, where the little boy, the protagonist, is trapped in a tube scared me and I am still haunted in my dreams by disfigured, crawling children.However, I can't give the book 5 stars because I simply thought the intro/beginning was too long and boring. So long and boring that I almost made the mistake of quitting rest of the book.
"
"
  Love this book!
"
"
  One of they many interesting aspects of this book lies not in the well crafted horror story of ghosts but in the everday horror story of the psychological portrail of the devastating effect upon a dysfunctional family of alcohol abuse.
"
"
  Read this book years ago and with the new one coming out decided to go again before the next read. As good as the first time
"
"
  Seen the film umpteen times but the book is another experience and loved it. Great writing from the Master of his trade.
"
"
  Never given Stephen King a go before but since I've enjoyed loads of film or tv adaptations thought I'd have a look. The Shining is just brilliant. I don't read horror much but I'm already planning 'It' and 'The Stand' after this. What really surprised me though was the skill with which King first draws you into his excellently realised world then kicks the door shut behind you. The Kubrick film has always fascinated me and it's great to read the source material first hand. It both informs the film and also differs in some fundamental ways. The depiction of a young family falling apart is touching and intelligent. But the 'shining' itself is one creepy gift. Great book, great read.
"
"
  if you are into horror books then this is a great read. after watching the film i found the book a lot better.it describes more about what's happening and the feelings.this book is exellent i've read it twice and i'm still not bored.it's interesting, gripping and makes you want to read more.
"
"
  The Shining had me gripped from start to finish! after already reading some of his other books including the stand, IT, pet semetery and cujo, i was told by a friend to give the shining a go. but after watching the film it didnt appeal to me, as i was told people who saw the film first generaly prefered the film, and vice versa, so i thought it would be a waste of time.HELL NO!compared to the book, the film sucked! the book contained scenes including the moving hedge animals which really chilled my bones when i was reading it (just imagine something that shouldnt move, but is closer to you every time you turn to look at it...*shudder*) and the part with danny in the play area and ""something"" grabbing at him in the tube. why didnt the film have that?!also, because i watched the film first, i couldnt get the image of jack nicholson out of my head every time the book concerned jack torrance, which, in the end, seemed to spoil it slightly for me. the characters didnt have their own identity, they were the actors in the film.but, im rambling. the book was a great read from page one right up untill the end. even the occasional chapter describing Mr Halloran trying to get back, didnt have much urgancy in the writing, but there was still a hint of suspence as you wanted him to get back as quickly as possable.so, in conclusion, if you have the choice, i would deffinatly read the book first before watching the film, possibly not watching the film at all. awesom read!(P.S...the ending in the book is better too)
"
"
  Thought I give this a read as the sequel is coming out later this year. I had seen the film many years ago, but know that books often differ from the film.If you haven't read this, I recommend you give it a go.It is different from the film in so many ways. You get a depth if character from the book that you don't see in the film.I can't say anymore without giving away spoilers, but read it. It'll be worth it. It'll leave you disturbed and relieved by turns as only Steven King books can.
"
"
  It's winter. You're off work with flu.  A couple of days in bed. You start reading The Shining.After a couple of days, you return from The Overlook and suddenly you are cured, having been in the most wretched, the most  beautiful building in the world of fiction.King will never write  anything like this again - no one will.
"
"
  This book is excellent, i recommend it to anyone who likes a good horror. I think that the book in general is a bit slow starting but you realise that the start is a real help for the action packed end. The character building is excellent giving the feeling like you actually know the day in and out lives of the Torrances! This is a Must Buy !!!
"
"
  Very nice
"
"
  One of my favourites. So many scary scenes.
"
"
  Stephen king is amazing i have always enjoyed this bookThe story is amazing and so are the charactersI would recommend this book to anyone that's a big fan like meAm going to start on doctor sleep now can't wait.
"
"
  As someone who saw the film version (with Jack Nicholson) a number of years ago and was scared by that and enjoyed it I decided to read the book and was not dissapointed.  The book is even better than the film, it had sections which went more in depth into the psychosis and scenes which were completely edited from the film. A definate read for anyone, I could not put it down, even those who hate reading would find it hard not to enjoy this gripping and exciting story!
"
"
  In short, a fantastic page turner! Really gets you thinking of how a normal man with a few issues can turn into a complete psycho. Much better than the film, very eerie, well written. Definitely in my top 3 books of all time.
"
"
  This has to be one of the best Stephen King books that I have read. I think it is true when they say 'read a book before you see the film' as the book goes into so much more detail than the film - (which didn't seem to mention Jack's abusive father, or actually go into depth about the theme of the film - the fact that Danny has 'the shining') If you are a devout Stephen King reader, buy this book!
"
"
  A great book that I have enjoyed reading many times. Such a shame that the Kindle addition has so many typos.
"
"
  From the first page i read i was totaly hooked, i couldnt get enough of the book a definate buy for anyone who loves reading!!! If you start reading you'll find it hard to put down
"
"
  Was looking forward to reading The Shining but was disappointed. I couldn't put it down but only because I was hoping it would get better.
"
"
  Great story. Arrived as stated, in perfect condition.
"
"
  I really hated this book. it took me a month to read and even then I gave up with 100 pages left. I didnt find it scary or compelling, though I did watch the film first so that maybe took away some of the suspense.I couldn't get into it because there was so. much. filler. This should have been about 200 pages shorter.
"
"
  Fantastic book, never read anything as quick as this!!! Everyone should read it, great story line and am sure most of you will enjoy reading it. That book should definitely be in your kindle collection.
"
"
  This book tells the story of Jack Torrance and his family, who are given the job of looking after the Overlook hotel over the winter.  Danny, his son, has visions of things that have happened there, such as blood on the wallpaper and the lady in room 217.  Personally, I did like this book, although it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be.  It was creepy and had a good story, but it was slightly dissappointing.

  Browsing through ""1001 Books you must read before you die"" - it was something of a surprise to find The Shining listed, when so much of Stephen King's work is dismissed by critics.  But what a revelation the book is, and I'm glad I read it.  This really is superior horror material, crafted to keep the pages turning.  Over-shadowed by the film (which King himself didn't like) - the novel is a deeper, scarier experience, a fine example of the skill of wonderful storytelling.  In a specially written introduction for this edition of The Shining, King reveals this was the book that took him in a different direction - where the characters are all the more scary because their demons are real as well as imagined.  Compelling.
"
"
  Returned to seller as not a 1st edition as described. The picture is also of a 1st edition cover but not what arrived. Instead I got a late edition book club copy. Poor show indeed.
"
"
  I wanted to read this book purely because its so famous, and it turns out deservedly so! One of the best written books i've ever read!
"
"
  I can not fault this book accept why does it have to end.I could not put the book down great read great buy
"
"
  It is ironic that Stephen King ""hated"" the Kubrick masterpiece The Shining. Because the film is far, far better than this mediocre book. It was interesting to read it again after all these years, as it really made me appreciate the genius of Stanley Kubrick. He made a silk purse out of a sows ear. Kudos to King for coming up with the characters and the setting, but that's about it.
"
"
  This book is definetly King at his best! The film was fab but the book has a totally different ending which is in fact better and is so mysterious and macarbe you cant sleep at night. Takes a while to get into, and to get Jack Nichlosons face out of your mind, but once you get past this, its impossible to put down. Great late night reading! If you enjoyed this I also recommend Richard Laymon as he has very similar writing skills.
"
"
  Very easy to read on the kindle! Classic! Stephen King at his best! Can't wait to read Dr Sleep - The Shining 2
"
"
  i have to say this is the best novel i have ever read by king or any writer, it is a true masterpiece, full of suspense, fear and general madness, if the blurb couldn't convince you i hope this will - i reccomend this book to anyone who likes a good ol' horror novel!
"
"
  Couldn't finish it. Really don't know what all the fuss is about.
"
"
  Firstly, I have to say I didn't like the film - too rambling and not enough happening.Reading some reviews here I thought the book would be different, but I gave up about halfway through. I'd read the equivalent of a novel and very little had happened apart from the main character and his wife and kid go to look after an old hotel.Each to their own and all that, but this is the side of Stephen Kng I just don't like -  pages and pages of character description and very little plot to speak of (and what plot there is is muddled). I constantly found myself skipping pages of mush and saying to myself 'hope the story starts soon'.I prefer some of the characterisation to be left with the reader to work out through action and dialogue which SK does so well elsewhere.Not one of his best.
"
"
  Its hard for me to write a review without at some point comparing it to the film so I'll get it out of the way with now. The film only takes the basics of the story and then adds a touch of hollywood clamour inlcuding the famous line ""here's Jonny"" and removes some darker and harder points to convey on film to make it appeal a larger audience. I was lucky to have read the book before seeing the film and I'm glad because whilst it wouldn't have ruined the story (it is a brillant film, well acted and directed) I was approaching it knowing nothing so increasing the suspense factor. It also meant that when watching the film with friends I could bore them all by constantly mentioning differences between the 2, we dont speak much anymore!The basic plot is that the Jack Torrance has signed on to be the custodian of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado and takes his family (wife and child) to live there over the winter when it is cut off from civilisation. He is a recovered alcoholic carrying many deamons including breaking his son's (Danny) arm after losing a job. Going there, he believes, will allow him to recover and also to work on the play he has been writing. However Danny has a powerful gift ""the Shine"" allowing him to see things that he should not be able to including grim visions of the previous caretaker and family. The Overlook craves for this power for itself and through various ways attempts to influence Jack into killing his family so it can take the power for itself.This was only the second Stephen King book I had read (1st being Desperation also good!) so I was taken a back by how far he works to develop characters and how he will not shy away from ugly scenes and plots that he feels important to a story. I think the most striking thing I felt from reading this is just how terrifying the book is! I was unable to go upstairs on my own for days, going to friends houses if left on my own because I was sure that someone had just stepped out of the bath tub, and paranoid about hedge animals that I swear had just started to move!It is well worth reading however I would not recommend listening to the same album whilst reading it because it has ruined one of my favorite records because even now track 1 sends my pulse racing as I wonder if anything is coming up behind me! Once you start reading this you won't be able to put it down until the final page. Now to start reading the Stand...
"
"
  Stephen King Rocks! On a second reading, and even now at 30 odd years old, the book still gave me nightmares. One of the best.
"
"
  It all started when I saw the music video 'The Kill' by 30 Seconds To Mars (on You Tube), realised it was based on The Shining and decided I had to have a read of the book itself to see what it was all about.  How's that for joined up thinking!Apparently Stephen King thought up the storyline for The Shining when he went on an impromptu holiday with his wife to a hotel in Colorado.  The hotel was closing down for the season and King and his wife were the only two people there.  The eerie surroundings and long empty corridors gave King the ideas for his book.The book is really well written.  I love the way a character will say something and then King writes what they are really/subconsicously thinking in italics underneath.  It gives you a lot more insight into what's happening.  The characters are instantly believable and you can really feel for them - to me that's always the sign of a good book.  You get so engrossed in the story, you forget everything else while you're reading.  I'd thoroughly recommend this book.  Enjoy!
"
"
  Yes, this novel keeps you thinking, wondering and indeed reading. King has a way of making the unreal seem very realistic, by making you live within the plot right till the end. Good read...
"
"
  Scary, thrilling, captivating ~ the ultimate page turner. You will not be able to put it down.Read this if you've ever been unsure about trying Stephen King.
"
"
  Its still of of Stephen Kings best books. Forget the film. The book is a great read and has almost gone and been forgotten.This is a classic piece of litrature.
"
"
  Great read so far! But will confuse you if you've watched just the Stanley Kubrick film and not the miniseries. I actually bought this 9 years ago and couldn't understand it as I'd never seen and knew that there was a miniseries. But now I've seen the miniseries it's alot easier to follow
"
"
  Having just finished reading this book, I've got to say it's so much better than anything else I've ever read ( Well except maybe IT, at a  push), all you Stephen King virgins out there get this book now. You don't  know what you're missing.  REDRUM.
"
"
  even though I saw the film first, I still really enjoyed the book just as much or maybe even more. this book really is a must read for everyone.
"
"
  really enjoyed this book i read it in 4 days, could not put it down. I thought the film was good but the book is even better, a total must read.
"
"
  Very slow. Full of long-winded descriptions that lasts for several pages. Overly descriptive of insignificant, uninteresting details. The farfetched parts (such as bushes coming to life) ruined my ability to be drawn in.Couldn't wait for the book to end.
"
"
  this is the first stephen king book i have read and i am now looking to read as many as i can. it was great.
"
"
  The phrase ""the book is much better than the film"" is most likely over used - but in the case of this book it is justified!A thrilling spooky page turner that, in my opinion, is better on re-reading than it was the first time I read it in my teens. The film does not do it justice.A ""must add"" for your reading list!
"
"
  I first read this  when it was first published.  If you are yet to read this splendid book, look out for the passage about the clock under the glass dome.  I can honestly say that this is the only passage in any book I have read, that actually made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.  Just read it again recently and believe me it's  lost nothing with the passage of time.
"
"
  I loved this book, very different to the film and it reminded me of King's the Skeleton Crew Short Stories with its simple but strong story line which really draws you in.I much prefer these earlier works to his later horror stuff.
"
"
  Well, I managed 190 pages and all I got for my persaverience was a brief encounter with a wasp nest. This rambling rubbish has to rate as the most borning novel I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Those that have given it glowing reviews must he credited with having the patients of saints.
"
"
  This book was the one that really got me into reading Stephen King.  And now approx. 20 years later, I'm still a great fan, on my way to The Dark Tower !!If you're into mindblowing descriptions of complexe human characters in a fantastic universe, this is THE novel.  You laugh and cry (mostly the latter !!) when you read this book.  It's FANTASTIC !!!
"
"
  well its a good book.  i Was sitting up all night when i got scared of the guy in the dog suit, and i nearly cried when Jack hurt Danny after he told him about the hedge animals. thank you stephen king for writing a great and scary book... too many swear words thoughEllie Frost aged 12

  I usually read crime thrillers, but fancied a change of genre. I always wondered whether a book could scare me and considering Stephens King's critical claim and praise it made sense to pick up one of his books. He's probably one of the most well known names amongst authors, so i had hoped to get into his books since he had written so many.The Shining is a well known film and after reading favorable reviews on Amazon i decided it was a good place to start. However the results is a big let down. I never actually finished the book. The narration is dull, boring, ploddy and not at all gripping or scary. Everyone says how scary it is - it isn't! Nothing happens for around 90% of the book and a lot of scenes feel like there being repeated. The whole book consists of backstory and pointless incidents, just where the characters are thinking or reminising about people and incidents that feel very unessersary to the main plot. Although, the chracters have plenty of depth and you feel like you know them. In fact i would say this is the main strength of the book, that and some beautiful moments of description. Unfortuanlty the narration is not consistent and in general it is difficult to read and stay focused becuase its boring.Alot of the times i found my self scanning lots and lots of pages that were filled with pointless description. The scenrios are just borning and half the time i didn't have a clue what was going on or what was real or just a dream. A few so called scary moments were pretty tame in this day and age if not slightly disturbing. Kings narration is very fustrating and dated, often mumbling on about nothing in paticular and at some points he doesn't make any sense. It is not a nice read or remotly enjoyable.I think because i new the jist of the story quite well even though i haven't seen the film adaption it was kinda predictable and there were no twists, shocks or thrills amongst the tedious chapters. I found the characters of Wendy and Danny very annoying and quite honestly i would kill them if i was locked in a house with them for over a month! Jack is a disturbed individual although i kinda got the feeling that at times King was describing himself. Considering all the aclaim this is very dissapointing and unbeleibvably overatted like alot of books and films i have found.To say the least i will not be picking up a King novel again. Maybe i'm not superior enough to appreciate this kind of book i don't know, but even if it is slightly good at points it is no way as good as people say and i didn't even finish because i became bored and frankly i could guess the ending. Maybe if i new nothing about the story i would have held on for the climax, but by the last few pages i just didn't care and so i gave up. So i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even horror fans because the bottom line is there are probably far better novels out there that don't fustrate and annoy and get straight to the thrills and shocks instead of baffling on about characters that you don't even like. Don't waste your money on this one.

  This was my first read by stephen king, I usually  read gory thrillers and thought i would give this a go for a change, I was so disappointed, the book I didn't  find scary at all. I will not let this disappointment stop me from trying another as I have read he is an amazing author , any suggestions welcome .

  I thought that this book was excellent and and enjoyable but at the same time thrilling read very much loved

  This is one of the best books I have ever read. Shows Stephen king at his best. Everyone should read this book
"

  i watched the film about a month ago, i wasn't impressed but i decided to read the book. i read it and i found it extraordinary dull. All the characters are one-dimensional. Danny and jack are so damn annoying, i felt as if i wanted to punch the living daylights out of them. King's works are pretty much the same thing. same plot. same characters. same endings. why doesn't he stop writing?if you want to we scared out of your pants then read Poe or Harries novels.

  I'm a big fan of the horror genre when it comes to books and generally, I really enjoy Stephen King's novels, having read many of his books in the past.  'The Shining' was one of his works that I have had on my ""must read"" list for many years and only recently got around to starting it.  It has a massive cult following and a reputation for being one of the scariest books ever written - well, I'm afraid to say I strongly disagree.  This tale didn't so much as raise a single goose-bump and was a real chore to finish.  I didn't really care too much for any of the characters and didn't feel that the plot went anywhere at all - I was just glad when the whole thing was finished so I could start on a new book!

"
  Love Stephen king. This was a very good read. Keeps you guessing everytime and most of the time you don't want to put it down. I found some parts when reading I got angry or was sad but it kept me wanting more. The ending was perfect and I would  highly recommend this book.
"

  Usual Stephen king brilliance, unable to stop reading, kept me jumping throughout and anticipating the next scare. Well worth a read.

  Separate to the movie experience (which is awesome in its own right) -- this book is a gripping read.

  I think that this is a fantastic novel by Stephen King about fear, despair, love, hatred, and insanity. I also recommend the sequel, Doctor Sleep.

  Actual rating: 4.25 <U+0001F31F>Obviously this story is a famous one, which led to me not being all too surprised at the things that happened, but this doesn't mean that reading this book wasn't exciting and didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. In fact, the suspense is spread in the right amount of doses throughout the book, which is something I would love to see more often. I read many stories where one thrilling thing happens after another, which just gets repetitive after awhile and takes away from the excitement. King, however, knows how to keep you hooked without ever going over the top.Despite my copy having over 600 pages, I felt entertained throughout and was never bored. This is how suspense is supposed to be written.Obviously, many strange things happen in this story. Many of them might even seem completely unbelievable and ridiculous. But once again, King has a way of writing that makes everything sound like they could actually happen. I don't know how he does it, but every time I read something by him I think to myself:""Yeah sure, of course this is plausible. Of course this can be a thing.""No matter how out of this world the plot may seem.I really liked how every character in this book had a distinctive voice, even though there were many changes of the point of view. This shows what great and realistic characters Stephen King creates every time. Especially the main character Jack struck a chord with me, even though I am nothing like him. But there was just something about him...I don't know how to describe it, but he was written in a way that made all his actions seem somehow comprehensible, no matter how shocking they might have been.Of course everybody reads a book differently and interprets it in their own way. For me, this wasn't just a simple ghost story. For me, it was about a man coming to terms with his own demons more than ever before, and finally facing up to something he has lost control over a long time ago.The only reason this book doesn't get the full five stars from me, is because I didn't get lost in this world as much as I did in the other works by the same author.

  First time I read it I couldn't put it down as it was the first adult book I read. I'm really looking forward to reading Doctor Sleep.
"

  My first Stephen King read. And I don't think I'll be reading another one anytime soon. Because this book gave me the creeps.There have been so many books that left me disappointed despite being hyped and loved. And only very few that did live upto my expectations. Clearly, THE SHINING falls in the latter category. I had never read a horror-thriller book. I was always curious about how a book had the capability of evoking creepy disturbing thoughts in your head and leave you scared. THE SHINING made me experience all that. And that's why I loved it so much.

  To begin with it took me three weeks to read this novel. I was scared to bits and I still am. NOT recommending this book for the weak hearts!The book begins with the introduction of the “Torrance family” that has Jack, Wendy and their five year-old son Danny. Jack is talented but not successful as a writer. His alcoholism and temper made him lose his job and has nearly destroyed an ability he had to earn a living. He gets his last chance, through the offices of an old friend, which is to work as a caretaker in the “Outlook Hotel”.During the winter months, the hotel gets covered in snow and is inaccessible, Jack and his family sign the four months contract of complete isolation. As an added warning by one of the employees, Jack was told that the previous caretaker Grady had gone crazy with cabin fever and killed his wife and two daughters and then himself. Knowing that he has no other options, Jack agrees to take the job in the hopes that when spring comes, his play will be completed and the family will be able to make a fresh start.A famous horror novel, “The Shining” has the ability to scare its readers. The book is not very violent, but there are many jump scares and disturbing accounts, many of which may be too frightening for the fresh readers. It deals with themes of demonic possession and maintains an unsettling atmosphere throughout.Lastly, I’m a big fan of horror movies and novels, but this is quite possibly the scariest I’ve ever read. This is not a gory, jump-scare heavy, fright fest, it’s a slow burn movie that doesn’t need those things to scare you.#A Great Masterpiece! No wonder Stephen King is a “PRO” in horror writing!

  This book is a masterpiece in its own terms , unravelling the path of insanity.Digging deep down in the root cause of the dark side of a person. Because sometimes dark side of a person gets an upper hand . Paper quality is great and the book looks of premium quality. I got it for 331 (best deal) and I'm happy that I didn't chose flipkart's deal ( which was 200 bucks higher)THIS IS A MUST BUY NOVEL

   A história eu amo mas a edição pelo preço que paguei não vale a pena ... na folha as letras atravessam , e encardenação clássica deveria ser especificado que é apenas uma edição de bolso capa dura ... pelo história seria 5 estrelas mas com esse edição dou no máximo 3

  Every book is subjective with regards to its reader and to me, The Shining is just an average book. It did not make it to the list of my favorites but I must say, this book was one heck of a read. As I knew the characters more, their backstories and everything, I realized that true horror isn't supernatural; it isn't an alien trying to ravage and destroy the human species; but it is the psychological trauma we go through when one of our own turns against us and tries to hurt us beyond pains unimaginable. You keep telling yourself that it isn't your family doing so but something else wearing the face of your family yet you can't just see through that veil. You can only see your loved one trying to hurt you in a fit of undefined anger and thirst for blood. This is utterly horrific and spine chilling than a ghost or alien trying to chase you to your doom. Of course, I must sincerely admit that the scenes which involved the hedges scared the wits out of my brain.I love how King took his time to let us explore the depths of every character involved in the book. The more you get to know about them, the more sorry you feel for them. He even gave us the backstory of the Overlook! I felt like the hotel wasn't a hotel but a person.~ Excerpt from my review on Goodreads

"
  This story holds a special place in my heart.I feel like it’s King at his most playful: poetic sometimes, playing with language and convention in order to create a near movie-like effect. As near as a movie as a book can feel. And this is separate from the fact that it WAS made into an incredible movie.Still all the same, there’s a little bit of Jack Torrence in all of us, and the expert way King uses imagery and evokes music and taste, is very much subconscious and alluring simultaneously; you don’t realize that you’re being pulled and thrown along into feeling, but you’re hooked nonetheless like the “pink whale” at the end.Can’t wait to read the sequel now, for the first time!

  SHININGAvevo già letto Shining in italiano, ma ero incuriosito dal leggere Stephen King in lingua originale, e devo dire che mai scelta fu migliore.Shining resta uno dei libri che forse più lasciano inquietudine e ansia, con ""scene"" lontane dagli horror a cui siamo abituati, ma forse per questo più potenti.Molti gli accadimenti che non vengono ripresi nel film, quindi cuore a mille ancora più assicurato

  Si eres fan de las historias de horror, tienes que leer este libro. El narrador te hace vivir toda una serie de emociones -desde amor hasta el terror total-. Es el primer libro de Stephen King que leo y me gano como fan. Si te gusto la pelicula de Kubrick (mi pelicula favorita de todos los tiempo cabe decir) vas a adorar el libro, que es -creelo o no- más escalofriante aún. Ojo: esta es la version original escrita en inglés.

  The Shining is one of those novels that is world-renowned for being at the top of their genre. I enjoyed it, but I did find it a little slow in parts. It's very much an object of its time. There's a scene towards the end of the book when Halloran is racing towards the hotel to try and save Danny. The Overlook's ""soul"" for want of a better description screams out a warning that made me freeze in my tracks. There is absolutely no way any author would get away using racial slurs like that in a modern story.However, I did enjoy it, and I'm intrigued as to what Stephen King did in the follow-up Doctor Sleep that I'm tempted to buy it.I didn't find it particularly scary (I can see where others might though), but it's extremely well written, and Stephen King has an awesome ability to turn a phrase on its head and make it glow that I wish I possessed.

  Imaginemos uma fusão entre os terrores reais e os sobrenaturais. Temos ,então, Jack Torrance, ex-professor, escritor e alcoólatra, que aposta suas poucas fichas em passar alguns meses isolado em um hotel no inverno, juntamente com a esposa e o filho a fim de escrever um livro e ganhar alguns trocados como zelador. O terror natural é o medo da miséria, da não aceitação, da perda da família. Entretanto, no hotel há também algo pior: lembranças de tragédias passadas que ali teimam em permanecer. Fantasmas. Para onde fugir, se todas as estradas estão fechadas e a neve não para de cair? Um dos melhores livros de Stephen King que já li. Se você curte terror e ainda não leu esta obra, não perca mais tempo: leia! Uma dica adicional: o livro em sua linguagem original é ótimo para o treino do inglês, bastante fluente e ágil.

  The story is about a cute 5 year old boy, Danny, who possess the ability to see the future and also some events that had occurred in the past. Danny lives with his parents, Jack & Wendy. After losing his job as a teacher in a school, Jack had no other option but to accept the job as a caretaker in a well established hotel, The Overlook. The hotel has it's own mysterious history and as it was their last hope, Jack moved to the hotel with his family. As their lives were getting back to normal, mysterious things begin to happen at the hotel. As the winter approaches, the hotel begins to develop a life of its own. Now, the hotel is trying to get on to Jack's head in order to make him kill Danny and Wendy.Stephen King's way of narration is just brilliant. I really loved the way in which he had portrayed Danny as a little kid who could act both childishly and maturely. Stephen King's writing has the power to keep you hooked to each and every line of the story. The story was so good that it was impossible for me to put this book down. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys horror genre.

  I saw the film years ago, I didn't like it much, and because of the film I never bothered reading the book, any Stephen King books as it happens.So I have finally read it and mostly liked it, especially the first third of the book, which goes into the character arc far more than the superficial film did. What I found though is after the first few chapters of the Hotel section (Middle) I was becoming bored with the repetition, and just wanted it end and get to the conclusion, if there was one. The end of the book the last 20% or so things improved again, not as good as the start but the story managed to move again.I guess that, had the book been about 20% shorter, cut from the middle, it would have been a much easier read and in places a damn fine book. As it was it was mostly a good book with bad dreary parts.Nothing like as bad as the crazy film but not as good as it could have been.

  I have heard alot about it but could not manage to finish it.I find Stephen's writing a bit deviated. While talking about the main thing, then shifts to some other topic and then to something else.If you dont understand it and really wanna read his work, movie can be watched and then book can be read.Also they started gave bookmark with it but their print is always the same.

  Es un libro magnífico, quizá exige un nivel de inglés alto para poder comprenderlo bien.Es mil veces mejor que la película,sin ninguna duda. Ahonda muchísimo en la historia de los personajes principales, se podría decir que la película es un vago resumen del libro, con un final completamente distinto además. Vas viendo como Jack se vuelve completamente loco, y además le entiendes a la vez que le odias. Entiendes por qué han llegado al hotel, todo lo que va pasando allí, etc. No he leído nada más de Stephen King,pero es sin duda de los libros que más he disfrutado!

  Since I was a kid I vaguely remember the shining and as I grew up I didn't remember it so well and watched it a few times as an adult but now appreciating movies as I got older.After watching Doctor Sleep I was very Impressed how well the movie was so I finally decided to get both books but chapters only had the doctor sleep so I waited for sometime to restock.Since I really needed my jewelry machine it only made sense to order it with it together because I needed to read it first.The only suggestion is with books please please always make sure you guys always choose a more mintier book, have an edge insert protector, or make sure the edges arent bent so hard as some people would like their books in pristine condition.I'm gonna keep it for now because I've been dying to read it but was looking to have it in mint so I can put it into a protector and add it to the book shelf but I'll get another one in the future to do that.Thanks guys!

  I didn't like it. It didn't scare me or creep me out. It just made me mildly uncomfortable that's all. I'm really really disappointed. After all the hype, this book fails to live up to it.At best the story is mediocre and repetitive. I'm giving it a reluctant 3 out of 5.

  The Shining is Disappointing novelwith boring plot despite having a Terrific characterization.The Shining movie may not be a good adaptation but Stanley Kubrick did a good thing by not COMPLETELY followingwhat Stephen King wrote in The Shining novelBook - 1/5Movie - 3/5Delivery and Quality - <U+0001F44D>Font size - must be improved.Novel - will update once I finish it.

  This book is really good because is of course from the king of horror himself Stephen King ! Every chapter push you more and more to read it and everything is awesome , the suspense, the words , the way is written etc... The only problem is that the paper is a little bit flimsy and thin but is of course a really big book so it would be expensive to print it on high quality material so is understandable and deserve 5 stars !

  O filme ja é um espetaculo a parte. Livros como sempre, sao melhores que os filmes. Mas este conseguiu ser muito melhor. E dado que eu gosto demais do filme, imaginem minha alegria ao ler este livro. Muito bom. A sequencia é muito boa tambem. Recomendo o Dr Sleep (Doutor Sono), tanto livro quanto filme.

  I like buying books such as these that have a motion picture adaptation because then I can associate the characters with the faces from the movie because I have no imagination. Unfortunately all the trademark moments from the movie are not actually in the book but it is still worth reading.

  The Shining revolves around Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy and their gifted son Danny who've come to take care of the Overlook hotel during it's off season. What takes place in this eerie hotel makes up the rest of the storyStephen King is an absolute beast at storytelling, no doubt. I felt that sometimes in the book, he went too far, explaining everything in excruciating detail which I thought was hindering me from progressing.The characters were well developed. King took a lot of pain to detail every character and shape them into what they are.Would recommend it to fans of the supernatural and horror genre.The paperback edition by Hodder is good. The print is easy to read and the spacing is decent. The quality of the cover is a little low but for the low price, it was worth it

  This is undoubtedly the best from stephen king. It's not just only a horror story but also you can feel the characters of the story. You can feel their pain their horror and survival from the ominous situation. Truly a must read for all horror lover.
"
"
  It's a classic horror story and it will not let your attention vain away. If you liked the movie then you will surely love this book because so much time and detail had been given to each and every character in this book.The quality of the book is good considering the price. it would have been really nice if they given a bookmark also.

  Pois é. Não gosto de Stephen King. Mas há dois livros dele que considero imperdíveis: um é esse clássico aí, ""O Iluminado"". O outro é um manual prático de como se escrever obras de ficção. Em suas memórias, SK afirma ter imergido no alcoolismo numa fase em que se encontrava na ocupação frustrada de professor. E tudo isso é um autorretrato espelhado no próprio protagonista. Mesmo que você não goste de ficção de terror, você sentirá medo ao virar cada página!

  A psychological thriller like no other, King manages to really elaborate such a well developed story in which every character adds something of value that everyone should read this book at least once.The premise is quite simple, a 5 year old with the ""shining"" goes with his parents to an hotel during the winter because his father is going to work there as a janitor. The simplicity, however, ends there, and the evolution and development the characters go through reflect the quality and power of King's writing skills.Please, read this book already, you will not regret it.

  Uno dei capolavori di King. L'ho preso in inglese dopo aver letto diversi suoi libri in italiano per rendermi conto di come scrivesse in lingua originale...e devo dire non è stato facile starci dietro (King fa largo uso di linguaggio colloquiale e di slang specialmente nei discorsi dei suoi personaggi). Comunque con un dizionario accanto (meglio se online, sono più aggiornati sul linguaggio di uso comune) si riesce a gustare bene la sua narrazione.Comunque il film di Kubrik non è fedele al libro, quindi se lo avete visto prima (come me d'altronde) fate conto che sia praticamente una storia ""a parte""!

  Bueno, barato y muy portátil, el libro siempre ha sido una maravilla y la edición de bolsillo hace más fácil llevarlo a varios lugares y darle una leída, la historia es muy diferente a la película y a mí gusto mejor, si tienes interés en leer la historia original no te vas a sentir decepcionado.

  Very Boring. I heard Stephen King was not happy with the movie of the Shinning. At least the movie moved along and kept you interested. Stephen King takes over half the book going in to boring background info of insignificant people. I like a book that is a page turner and keeps you interested. This book put me to sleep.

  Englische Taschenbücher sind ja häufig wesentlich günstiger als deutschsprachige. Trotzdem hätte ich mir gewünscht, dass das Buch komplett unversehrt ist, ist schließlich kein gebrauchtes Produkt, sondern angeblich neuwertig. Leider hat das Cover am unteren Rand leichte Abnutzungsspuren, ebenso am rechten oberen Eck. Ansonsten alles in Ordnung. Lieferung erfolgte wie fast immer sehr schnell.

  My first SK novel! More horrific than I had imagined. The characters, especially Ms. Massey and Horace Derwent are gruesome. One of the finest horror novels, besides 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Exorcist', 'Frankenstein' and 'Dracula'. The sequel could have been better, though. Reveals the true terrors of cabin fever.

  El libro es muy bueno, llegó en tiempo y lo disfruto. Cabe mencionar que es la versión en inglés.Lo malo es que llegó abierto y con un pequeño rasguño lateral. No lo regresé al no ser algo que evite su uso, sin embargo es importante que Amazon y/o la paquetera cuiden esos detalles.

  This adaptation of Stephen King's greatest horror story is better than the movie. I enjoyed every bit of the book and love how horrifying the Overlook hotel really changed Jack Torrance's psyche and mental state. The Shining is one of King's greatest novels ever written and I like how it takes a completely different outlook from the movie when it was released in 1980. Wendy and Danny are susceptible to being killed by Jack and the presence of the Shining that haunts the Overlook hotel. Great book to add to your reading list if you love horror novels!

  Stephen king is always best, the way he elaborate his story is just wonderful and an amazing storyteller. The realism in his book makes me shiver and give me nightmare. This is my 4th book of his and I  absolutely loved every book I read of Stephen king.  I have enjoyed reading this masterpiece. I had a hard time finishing the book because it was just too scary and terrifying. I love all the character, I sympathized with every character. I would definitely recommend everyone to read this book.
"
"
  Probably the best stephen king novel i have read till now.. his characters are fresh with a considerable amount of details in them.. the overlook hotel has been described to its full potential .. and it has the a beautiful ending which makes you have a different perspective about the characters in this novel.. the descent to insanity is portrayed magically with elaborate scenes on dilema and the hotels interactions with the torrances .. if you loved the movie and are satisfied by only watching it ... I advise you to read this book as it is totally different and more enjoyable ..

  Stephen King is a mastermind when it comes to writing believable Charakters with flaws,goals,Hobbys and emotions the Charakters feel as if they where real. Another thing that he's able to write at an expert level is paranoia like in the scene with Danny and the fire hose or the Hedge animals he executes these parts so we'll that I as a reader felt paranoid. He describes the hotel in such a detailed level that I really had an idea about how it must feel being in the Overlook . You also get introduced to a living building with his own personality and goals it's impressive that king is able to write an place with a Charakter that seems so realistic . The story is a bit long and some parts are really stretched out but it is totally worth reading. One of my most fun reads and at some points i even got scared Wich doesn't happen that often I would Totally recommend reading it if you are into great character work, haunted houses and horror.

  It is a good read, no doubt, but those who have liked the movie will be disappointed by the book. This is the first time I am preferring a movie over the book.

  Einiges an ""The Shining"" ist keine Überraschung. Zum Beispiel die für einen Horrorroman zur Zeit der Veröffentlichung enorme Länge von knapp 700 Seiten; (zu) lange Romane wurden dann später Kings Markenzeichen, inzwischen sind Horrorromane dieser Länge - King sei Dank - keine Seltenheit mehr. Auch die einzelnen Zutaten zum Roman sind klassische Genrekost und finden sich bei Shirley Jackson und anderen, frühen Autoren bereits in Fülle.King allerdings hat hier nicht nur die einzelnen Elemente stilsicher kombiniert und einen enorm spannenden Roman geschrieben; er hat nicht nur seinen Figuren, allen voran Jack Torrance, psychologische Tiefe und Glaubwürdigkeit verliehen. Vielmehr hat er bis tief in den Roman hinein Raum gelassen, Ereignisse entweder als übersinnlich oder aber als Folge einer psychischen Störung erklärlich zu machen. Jack Torrance, ein gewalttätiger Alkoholiker, der seine eigenen desolaten Verhaltensmuster in seiner Kindheit von seinem eigenen Vater vorgelebt bekommen hat, hat in seinem verzweifelten Bemühen um Verhaltensänderung fast etwas tragisches an sich. Er ist ein Mensch, der aus den Mustern seines Scheiterns ausbrechen will, doch braucht es hierzu seine ganze Kraft, vielleicht sogar mehr. Obwohl bei King die Kinder oft die Fehler der Eltern nicht nur erdulden und manchmal im wortwörtlichen Sinne überleben müssen, sondern diese oft genug selbst übernehmen, ist es doch gerade der fünfjährige Danny, der seinen Vater über alles liebt, ihn sogar, wie King wohl nicht ohne kleinen Triumph hervorhebt, sogar der Mutter vorzieht.Beim Lesen drängte sich mir der Eindruck auf, dass King in ""The Shining"" autobiographische Elemente verarbeitet hat, und vielleicht gerade darum ist Jack Torrance so vielschichtig und glaubwürdig.Ich habe nur einige Romane von King gelesen, aber dieser ist bislang mit Abstand sein bester. Und das hat neben den schon erwähnten Vorzügen auch und vor allem damit zu tun, dass er zwar lang, aber nicht zu lang ist. King rutscht oft in Geschwätzigkeit ab und füllt Seite um Seite, ohne dass es für die Handlung relevant ist. Als Leser habe ich oft einem Lektor die Macht gewünscht, sich gegen den Meister des Horror zu behaupten und die Werke zu kürzen. Auch gelegentlich viel zu lange Show-Downs sind leider wohl ein Markenzeichen von King. In ""The Shining"" aber entwickelt sich die Handlung gleichmäßig und folgt dabei ihrem eigenen Rhythmus. Längen sind mir beim Lesen nicht unangenehm aufgefallen, und der Höhepunkt des Buches zieht sich nicht über 200 oder mehr Seiten, sondern bildet tatsächlich den fulminanter Abschluß des Buches.

  É, sem dúvida, leitura obrigatória para quem é fã do King, ou simplesmente gosta do gênero.Mais uma vez, aqui, faz-se presente a capacidade do autor de desenvolver diálogos, personagens e criar eventos sobrenaturais a partir de situações triviais.Os únicos pontos negativos são em relação ao acabamento do livro. A capa é bastante frágil, e as folhas bem finas. O que faz com que devamos manusear com cuidado. Mas a meu ver não atrapalha a leitura.

  I think we all know that the book is great, that's why we are buying it, but my main concern was the quality because i have received tele-printed versions of book, and you may call me superficial, but I prefer the pages to be of a certain thickness, with a little rough texture and a little tinge of yellow. And the one by hodder publisher is just that. It was of good quality, with that typical, new book smell. The story of course is amazing. I loved every word of it. I can't believe I watched the movie first, that was a shame. All in all, it's a must-buy, and you should definitely let yourself enjoy this book
"
"
  If you're only going to read one horror book, make sure it's this one.This contains some of the scariest scenes I've ever read, and I no longer wonder how King got his reputation of master of horror.Truly perfect.
"
"
  This is usual Stephen King, slow and dark. I liked getting into the world of the story. But at certain point, I lost interest. It took a long time to get to the horror part. At times simply nothing happened to push the story forward. Only Stephen King's storytelling ability made me read till the end.
"
"
  Auch wenn man den (empfehlenswerten) Film von Stanley Kubrick bereits gesehen hat, lohnt sich das Lesen des Originalbuches trotzdem, da es wesentliche Unterschiede zum Film gibt.Auch die Miniserie von 1997 weist ein paar Unterschiede auf, kommt aber der Originalvorlage noch etwas näher. Auch diese Umsetzung würde ich empfehlen zu schauen.Zur Story muss nicht viel hinzugefügt werden, sie sollte bekannt sein.Ich habe das Buch als Softcover-Taschenbuch gekauft. Keine Besonderheiten festzustellen. Auf den Auszug aus Doctor Sleep hätte ich verzichten können.

  I read this book when I was seventeen and really liked it then.  What I took from it and thought about often over the years was Jack Torrence struggling with the fact that he really is a ""son of a bitch"".  He didn't want to be a bad guy, but he certainly was.  He had a temper like his own father.  I recently reread the book, to see if I remembered it clearly.  This time, as I read, I thought about how much fun it would be to make The Shining a movie again, but one truer to the book.  You get to see Jack have a quite touching relationship with his son.  You get to see him struggle with the choices he makes when dealing with a student.  You get to see the horrors of his alcoholism.  The Stanley Kubrick film is great, but the character of Jack Torrence barely exists, and Dick Halloran is really a useless character in the film.  Not so in the book.  I think we all struggle with the person we became compared to the person we see ourselves as.  That's what the Shining is really about.

  Wow, wow, WOW! If you haven't read this book because of the crappy movie (all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy) then do not wait any longer and read it TODAY.Either the book differed from the movie considerably or my memory of the movie was dramatically different... the book expanded so much more on Danny's (and others) shining ability and the hotel played a much bigger role (especially the hedges ;) )This book to me was as good as or better than Misery which to me was one of Stephen King's best books that I have read. I had a hard time to put this down.Can't say enough good about this book - don't delay give it a try and I'm sure you'll not be disappointed!

  I enjoyed this book.  I had seen the movie a few times, but had never read the book.  I do think that I enjoyed the movie a little more though (I usually like the source material more).

  ""The Shining"" ist ein unsterblicher Klassiker! Hier zeigt Stephen King seine größte Stärke: Das Buch lebt von den Charakteren, die zu jeder Sekunde überzeugen: Danny, Jack und Wendy sind Highlights, und ganz besonders Danny ist supergelungen: Seine kindliches Denken, seine Ängste, sein Vordringen in die Erwachsenenwelt - genial.Und anders als bei anderen Stephen-King-Büchern ist dem Meister die Vermischung des Alltäglichen mit dem Übernatürlichen hervorragend gelungen. Dannys telepathische Fähigkeiten werden so clever vom Autor aufgebaut und in der Geisterwelt des ""Overlook"" weiterentwickelt, dass das Unheimliche im Hotel überzeugend greifbar wird.Chapeau! 5 Sterne.PS: Das ungekürzte Hörbuch im englischen Original lässt einen jeden Satz, jedes Detail genießen. Nur leider wird es nicht von Stephen King selbst gelesen, der sich als begnadeter Vorleser bei ""Bag of Bones"" und ""On Writing"" erwiesen hat - die rauhe Stimme von Campbell Scott kommt zwar gut mit Jack zurecht, aber die direkten Reden von Wendy und Danny sind gewöhnungsbedürftig. Schade.

  I had read this book back when it was released in the late 70's, and heard that a sequel was in the works for 2013. I bought the Kindle version, figuring that since I was no longer an easy-to-frighten teenager the book would just be a quick weekend read.  Nope!  My return to the Overlook was just as terrifying as the first time.  I had forgotten all the subtle storylines that were omitted when it had been made into the movie.I look forward to the release of his sequel this autumn!

  La mia recensione riguarda la qualità dell'edizione in copertina flessibile. Le pagine non sono chiare, ma di un grigio tipo carta di giornale che non mette in gran risalto i caratteri.

  The book takes you through some dark places in and out of people's heads. The emotion and characters are very well based an built up through the story. It is in all a well imagined book. But I wouldn't call it scary. May be I'm just not someone for horror books..
"
"
  Having watched the movie over and over again, I thought I would be deceived by the book (if anything, because of the difference between the two of them); instead, I found the book as an ""alternative version of the movie"", meaning that I found the book and the movie as equally entertaining and frightening.Beautifully written, sent chills down my spine.All in all, one of his best books.
"
"
  Trouble with reading popular book like 'The Shining' is that there are too many SPOILERS!!!!!!!!If it weren't for those dam SPOILERS, this would have been a more enjoyable read for me perhaps. As always great characters, details and storytelling from 'The King'.

  Absolutely loved it and am a huge fan of horror and suspense stories. Kings portrayal of Jack and Tony was grand and loved that Danny could do and deal with so much, that you feel sympathy for him.  Although it was a long read,  I enjoyed the sense of fear for what they were seeing.  Definitely worth the read and can't wait to read Doctor Sleep.

  It had been many years since I read this novel so decided to read it again. I`m glad i did as I saw it this time from a slightly different perspective. I also chose to read it again as I wanted to be reminded of the story before I begin the sequel dealing with Danny as an adult. At times I became impatient with the speed at which the story was developing, it seemed to be dragged out in places but overall I enjoyed it.
"
"
  Great book. Not typical Stephen King in the sense that the first 300 pages are not spent developing characters only. That being said I am a huge Stephen King fan. Decided to pick up the book as I hear that the author was initially desapointed with Kubrick's film as apparently it was not true to the book. Great book, pick it up and you won't be able to put it back down!

  Stephen King's Bestseller ""The Shining"" ist ein fesselnder Psychothriller, bei dem die Grenzen zwischen Traum und Wirklichkeit, Realität und Wahnsinn verschwimmen. Besonders empfehlenswert, da es King nicht nur gelingt, den kleinen Danny mit seiner besonderen Gabe so anschaulich und liebenswert darzustellen, sondern auch die dunklen Abgründe der Psyche des ehemals alkoholabhängigen Vaters mit schwerer Kindheit und dessen große Liebe zu seinem Sohn so eindrucksvoll auszuleuchten.

  All I would say is that, Stephen King, You have bewitched me body and soul. His writing is so gorgeous, So obliviously frantic (in a good way). His novels of course have their own positive and negative point but they are all greattt. At last, this is a MUST READ STEPHAN KING NOVEL. One of his best works best.
"
"
  I am personally a big fan of Stephen King and I can assure you that this book is one of his best book. I think the story is more related to psychology than horror. So reade this book to know what happened to Torrance family in that haunted claustrophobic overlook. Wish you a good read. Tge book will definitely 'REDRUM' you<U+0001F601>.

  The first part of the Danny Torrance’s journey and its sequel represent one of the most amazing Stephen King’s works! Although it has taken time to be finally finished, the story has kept the incredible creativity as any other masterpiece from the author. I have no complaints about it! I recommend!

  The actual printed price of this book is <U+20B9>399, but the product description wrongly shows the price <U+20B9>499, duping the customers to believe in higher discounts.

"
  A obra é quase impecável, capaz de fazer o leitor sentir calafrios enquanto lê. Poderia muito bem ter se estendido em vários volumes se fosse escrita de outra forma. Nem por isso, deixa de apresentar riqueza de detalhes e profundidade nos personagens, chegando a ser frustrante ver o filme após ler a obra. O único defeito, se é que é uma falha, é a ausência de um final horripilante. Nos últimos capítulos, se conta, na verdade, uma história de ação, de caça e não uma história de terror. Mesmo assim, muito bom, não dá vontade de largar.

  Stephen King brilliantly tackles with the widespread problem of alcoholism and how it destroys families while also showing how the sanity of a man can decorate. Though a novel can't scare as much a movie can but this novel is one of the best horror novels of all time.

  Absolutely terrifying! That's what this novel can make you feel.The book revolves mostly on only three (living) characters and yet you don't get bored. You don't feel like putting the book down once you start reading it. Stephen King has taken a good part of the book trying to establish the characters and setting up the eerie atmosphere surrounding the hotel. Once that part is done, there is no stopping him. In the later half of the book, he let his thoughts run wild. At several moments in the book, I felt my heart race with fear and my hair rise with trepidation. Now, I dread every time while opening the curtain of my bathtub.As I have already seen the movie, I kept postponing reading this book thinking the book had nothing new to offer. Mistake. As scary as the movie version is, the book is scarier, more fearful, more intense. Go ahead, grab and read this novel if you haven't done it already.

  I ordered this one to re-read it prior to reading 'Doctor Sleep', to remind me of Danny past. I was surprise to find that it still is very scary and very good.If you read Dr Sleep right after , you will like it even more.And if you only saw the movie, this is a hundred time better.

  Love S.King. Nice addition to my book collection by the author

  Fantastic read. I was totally intrigued from the very first page. This book gets to you! Scary, creepy, good! If you are looking for a book that you can’t put away until your done and that has the potential to not let you sleep at night - this is it

  Habe zuerst den Film gesehen, der mich nebenher gesagt echt mitgenommen aber vorallem begeistert hat. Aber das Buch lohnt sich dennoch alle Mal, auch wenn man schon in den Genuss des Films gekommen ist. Abgesehen davon wird es, also das Buch, seinem Ruf mehr als gerecht.

  Shining is a key novel regarding the topics affecting King through his life and his books. Behind the present, there is always a past and sometimes the evil looking for us to break through with killer instinct. Excellent Narrator.

  Je fais partie de ces personnes qui ont lu le livre avant de voir le film et TANT MIEUX!Le film ne rend en rien la force du roman (sans parler des innombrables incohérences et inventions du scénario). Stephen King fait monter petit à petit la pression et l'horreur. L'évolution de la folie de Torrance prend le lecteur dans un étau. On tourne les pages de plus en plus vite en se sentant totalement oppressés. L'univers clos de l’hôtel piégé par la neige rend totalement claustrophobe. Les scènes de poursuites diverses et variées nous donnent l'impression d'être dans un de ces rêves où l'on se sent traqués mais où l'on est incapable de courir.Du grand King! Vous pouvez zapper le film sans aucun regret!

  Read this book as a Teen. Bought it just to see if I still found it scary. Guess what? I did! Its every bit as scary, intriguing, engaging and unputdownable.  Brilliant book. In my opinion its the best of Stephen Kings works.

  This is the 1st book of King i read and i completely fell in love With it. A complete page turner
"
"
  Stephen King's ""The Shining"" is a perfect novel. It's not only the best SK book EVER, but the best horror novel EVER. I've always been a huge fan of his work ever since I read this book, so if you read this one, you'll be highly tempted to read more which I also highly advise.

  Ich hatte The Shining schonmal vor ca. 20 Jahren gelesen und nun wieder. Hat nichts von seinem Charme verloren. (Kann man auch öfter als nur alle 20 Jahre lesen.)  Stephen King kann nicht nur super Spannung erzeugen; er versetzt einen auch wunderbar in die Atmosphäre in den USA.

  ""The Shining"" ist ein unsterblicher Klassiker! Hier zeigt Stephen King seine größte Stärke: Das Buch lebt von den Charakteren, die zu jeder Sekunde überzeugen: Danny, Jack und Wendy sind Highlights, und ganz besonders Danny ist supergelungen: Seine kindliches Denken, seine Ängste, sein Vordringen in die Erwachsenenwelt - genial.Und anders als bei anderen Stephen-King-Büchern ist dem Meister die Vermischung des Alltäglichen mit dem Übernatürlichen hervorragend gelungen. Dannys telepathische Fähigkeiten werden so clever vom Autor aufgebaut und in der Geisterwelt des ""Overlook"" weiterentwickelt, dass das Unheimliche im Hotel überzeugend greifbar wird.Chapeau! 5 Sterne.PS: Das ungekürzte Hörbuch im englischen Original lässt einen jeden Satz, jedes Detail genießen. Nur leider wird es nicht von Stephen King selbst gelesen, der sich als begnadeter Vorleser bei ""Bag of Bones"" und ""On Writing"" erwiesen hat - die rauhe Stimme von Campbell Scott kommt zwar gut mit Jack zurecht, aber die direkten Reden von Wendy und Danny sind gewöhnungsbedürftig. Schade.

  excellent thriller mondialement connu de stephen king, même s'il y a qques longueurs parfois car il a été écrit dans les années 70. et le rythme était différent à l'époque. On s'y crois néanmoins ! J'ai acheté la suite, Doctor Sleep, envoûtant aussi!

  ATTENZIONE: Libro in lingua Inglese!Il libro in sè è tra i migliori di quelli scritti da Stephen King ed è un classico, la cui vicenda è conosciuta da tutti, avendo ispirato l'omonimo film di Stanley Kubrick.La storia e l'ambientazione sono infatti decisamente accattivanti e spingono il lettore a calarsi nella parte dei personaggi.Il difetto è quello di molti libri dello stesso autore, ossia la constante interruzione della narrazione della vicenda al fine di raccontare il passato ed il background psicologico e personale dei vari personaggi, rallentando il ritmo dello sviluppo della storia e perdendosi in prolisse descrizioni di ricordi, pensieri e vicende che poco hanno a che vedere con la trama, al solo scopo di dare più spessore ai personaggi.Sebbene per alcuni lettori questo aiuti a dare maggiore profondità al libro, ad altri, me compreso, questo provoca solo un distacco dalle effettive vicende narrate nella trama, che vengono riprese ad intervalli più o meno regolari, tra una dissertazione e l'altra sul passato dei vari protagonisti.Questa è una costante nella narrazione di Stephen King, basti pensare a ""The Dome"" e altri romanzi simili, in cui il fenomeno è addirittura accentuato in quanto i personaggi sono decisamente più numerosi.Il risultato finale è spesso quello di un libro lento, pesante e a volte illeggibile. Non è il caso di ""Shining"", in quanto i personaggi sono in numero limitato e la narrazione, bene o male, avanza con lo scorrere delle pagine, però lo stile narrativo è sempre lo stesso: ottimi spunti legati all'ambientazione, alla suspance, inframmezzati dal costante divagare nei flash-back dei protagonisti.Dare spessore e corpo ai personaggi di un libro è un'ottima soluzione per calare il lettore nell'ambientazione del romanzo, ma ci sono modi molto più efficaci e scorrevoli per farlo, basta leggere ""Le cronache del ghiaccio e del fuoco"" di George R. R. Martin per rendersene conto, senza dover scomodare Tolkien, con i suoi capolavori.

  Unlike movies and some horror books, it doesn't have jumpscares or things like that. Rather it builds up the fear like a balloon and then bursts it suddenly which leaves you goosebumped. For further reviews contact :Joey Tribbiani 639-25-PIZZA

  my favourite book in horror genre...some parts in the book really gave me the creeps...very entertaining...totally different from the movie( movie is a masterpiece though)..very well written...america of 1970s ( rebellious and commercialized) is very nicely shown in the book... a real treat for horror fans

  I now understand why SK was mad at Kubrick. The book is much deeper, emotional and scarier than the movie. I read Doctor Sleep right after and really enjoyed both of them.

  The book starts off with this family moving in as caretakers of the Overlook Hotel (a hotel with a horrific past) during the off season, and slowly the plot builds. It is engaging and frightful and the same time! You really feel for Danny, a five year old boy who has 'the shining', and all the events are so well described from each characters point of view. If you are looking for a book that can keep you engrossed till the very end, this is the one!

  Of late I find myself reminiscing about the books of yesteryear, often those I read when I was more ""impressionable"",as it is put quite often.The ghost story, horror and other genres with similar intent have of late turned into a bland, convoluted, misconstrued mess, tripping over their feet, with pacing awry and the plot almost as dense as a children's show.*Spoilers Maybe*Revisiting this monolith reminded me of why I adored this genre and Stephen King. With a plot depicted with such prowess and loving, intricate detail and the character dynamics especially that of Jack and his son and his memories of his own father. His gradual descent into decadence and lunacy, Wendy and her primal motherhood, Dick and his selflessness and moreover The Overlook and its transient menace which exacerbates as the story progresses. It makes you feel at home with the characters, each one of them as you peruse through the book, a rarity in modern fiction. Do yourself a favour, just buy the book, it's worth it. Every dime.

  Il prodotto ricevuto non è quello rappresentato in foto.Corretto il titolo del libro, ma la sovracoperta non è quella rappresentata e per un collezionista questo fa la differenza. Il venditore si è offerto di lasciarmi il libro in cambio del rimborso del 50% delle spese sostenute. Ho accettato.

  Avrò letto questo libro mille volte! In italiano.Ora mi sto cimentando con l'inglese. Mitico!L'analisi psicologica del personaggio Torrance è notevolissima, quasi quasi verrebbe da dargli ragione. Evidentemente l'Overlook ha un influsso mortifero anche sui lettori...

  It's nothing short of awesome how the author keeps you on the edge of you seat. The insidious, maddening voices keep haunting you well after you put the book down. It's definitely a classic!

  It catches you and wouldn't let you go! Every character is so very well defined, deep and studied and it is very interesting to discover each one of them little by little.

  I read this masterpiece back when originally released. Following that, I have watched the Kubrick movie every Halloween since its release on DVD sometime last century. Love both. The book is dark and the movie captures the required essence, but the book gets deeper into Jack's mind which is not a fun place. The book and movie conflict on room #'s 217 vs. 237, and Wendy's hair color, which I have embedded as that of Ms. Duvall's. And anyone interested will find on the inter-web a plethora of reasons these were changed from book to movie. Fun stuff. If you have never read the Shining, please give yourself a gift and read it if you enjoy horror. And if you haven't read it this century, try it again, as it may very well scare you in new ways. I live in Maine and while SK is our scary hero, he is also a great neighbor in our state.

  I HIGHY RECOMMEND YOU THIS BOOK. I ALSO PERFER IT THAN THE MOVIE OF IT. BUT I CANT DEFINE WHICH IS BETTER. I THINK IT IS UP TO YOU THAT DECIDE WHICH IS BETTER AFTER YOU READ IT

  Thrilling, chilling in every way. A book that will scare the heck out of you and yet will draw you in so brilliantly that you feel you are right there in the notorious Overlook Hotel.

  I didn't like it much may be because I read it with lots of breaks in-between. The book created a feeling of horror  twice in whole reading. I didn't find it much frighting.

  The book content is great. No doubt about that. But would have to give 3 stars due to poor paper quality.I was disappointed since I buy a lot of books from amazon at very low price yet great paper quality. Killed the mood to read.Please find a better buyer for this book.

   I ordered this book for my daughter and it was misprinted. The cover looked like it was cut off and while we would’ve been fine with that, the inside of the book had the same problem. It was as if they printed the book crookedly because the words are off the page and it’s impossible to read. We’ve notified amazon and they say they are going to send another copy, hopefully the next copy is better.

  I had seen the movie before I read the book so going in I thought I knew what to expect. But I was actually caught off guard and found myself loving the book more then I loved the movie. I still think the movie is good but this book is just... more.The characters in this book are just so complex. Each one of them feels real. One moment I am sympathetic with Jack a man who just can't seem to get a break. But the next moment I am scared of him and what he might do to his family. Wendy is also so much more complex. I found myself really interested in her and absolutely scared for her life.Danny though is my favorite. He's such a bright and sweet boy and it was interesting to get into his head. I loved to read how conflicted he got between protecting his family but also not wanting to upset them. I also really love his interactions with Dick Hallorann who is also very interesting.Overall this is an excellent creepy read.

  Everyone likes to say ""the book is better"" whenever the subject of a movie that was based on a book comes up, whether they've read it or not. Stanley Kubrick did it better than Stephen King. I don't want to give spoilers, but in typical King fashion, this story entertains the supernatural more than the movie did, which I personally do not appreciate. My brain is not as artistically imaginative as Stanley Kubrick's work, and without the amazing acting by everyone in that film to fill in the blanks, it didn't make it into any kind of top 20 all time list for me like the film did. I do like that Danny is the main focus over Jack though, and I like the background it provides that the movie does not.Even so, it was gripping enough that I read it in 3 nights. And I'll probably reread it again in a year or so.

  I've been a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick's movie adaptation of The Shining since I was a kid. Every year in the fall I get the inkling to scare myself silly, and this year I decided to finally read Stephen King's book version of an old favorite movie. Suffice to say, I am so glad I finally took the time to read this book.There are so many subtle things in this book that build the anticipation and terror as it progresses. Several times I had to put it down for a day or two because I got a bit too freaked out by it. The imagery and description of the Overlook and characters as the story unfolds is intense and captivating. In particular, I was terrified by the scenes including the wasps, the hedge animals, and the use of the mallet. These are key differences between the book and the movie that I am shocked by, now that I've read the book. Those scenes were brilliantly written by King, and I actually am disappointed that they didn't make the movie version.Great book with lots of very intelligently woven themes about family, devotion, addiction, and overcoming personal demons. I highly recommend reading this if you haven't done so already.

  I generally find it difficult to get terribly engrossed in horror novels where supernatural entities (or divine for that matter) play a prominent role, and The Shining is a good example of such for me.  However, though I may not really have lost myself in this novel, King's skill at building suspense kept me turning the pages late into the night multiple times and it's been a while since that's happened.  There are many who write more eloquently, many who craft more impressive plots, and many who are more deft at building characters, but I think few exceed King in ability to make a reader simultaneously desire and dread reading the next paragraph or turning the page.  He is very, very good at describing various evil beings' appearances, actions, and manners of speaking.  I re-read several passages in The Shining multiple times just to gape again at what was happening or how a character just barely escaped a horrific death.Apart from The Running Man, a quite different type of novel, this is actually the first book by Stephen King I've read.  I do have a few more on the shelves and am really looking forward to them, not so much for the stories / plots but rather for the goosebumps and tension I experienced while reading The Shining.I ought to mention that King's style here is dry and matter of fact, and the family members seem quite wooden initially.  Over several chapters he does throw in a great deal of background history on the family and this helps flesh them out quite a bit, but they never became completely convincing to me.  This and the somewhat formulaic plot based on a haunted hotel detracted somewhat from the overall experience, but once winter set in and the action began I easily understood why King is so celebrated.

  I ordered this book for my collection specifically because i wanted it hard cover and with this specific cover. What i received looks like someone found a 50 cent book at a yard sale and sold it for almost $20. I am returning this work because it was listed different from what i received. Pretty disappointed.Update: decided to keep the book and read it again for the 3rd time.BrilliantStill , the seller wanted me to pay for the return . This is unfair given the description was incorrect.Won’t buy again from this seller but the book is a masterpiece and i highly recommend it

  If you are anything like me, you've never read a Stephen King book before, but you're an avid fan of the movies made off of his books, and horror. However, if you're like me, and are often wondering more about the characters, then you're here reading the reviews and or description of this book. I have to say, for my first Stephen King book, it did not disappoint. During this quarantine I've been watching old movies, and reading many books but nothing that was as captivating as this one. I watched the film about a week ago and decided I was going to order this book in order to do a compare and contrast.Boy was I wrong to think you could ever compare and contrast the two. While both works are beloved works of art I think they're simply two similar stories told in completely two different fashions. It's like looking at a picture and interpreting it differently. I can understand why Mr. King would hold such disdain for a film, considering he wrote the book. While others love the film. All that said, the book will had more depth (obviously) to the characters, you'll be scared, amazed, frightened, happy, and sad. All over the course of the book. You'll understand Jack in a completely different way and you'll be happy with the outcome of some characters and left wondering about others. I'm looking forward to reading Dr. Sleep now.

  I read this book many years ago and loved it so much. My nephew recently mentioned his interest in reading it since he just watched the movie, so I ordered it for him for Christmas. It arrived today and is in perfect shape. Shorter than I remembered! It felt like a really really long book when I was in high school, but looking at it now, it would be a breeze with large print and just around 700 pages. I may reread it again before I give it to him ha! It is one of my favorites from King. So detailed and much better than the original movie, which I also loved. Happy to be spreading the horror genre into the next generation.

  Jack Torrance is an aspiring author, who after being fired from his prestigious teaching job, is hired to be the winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel. Unfortunately for Jack’s young son Danny, who has a supernatural gift called The Shining, the hotel has a life of its own and it is feeding off Danny’s gift.My biggest gripe with this novel is King’s disastrous attempt to create a complicated villain. King gives Jack a painfully contrived past that instead of making Jack more interesting it just comes across as King making excuses for his protagonist. I think it would been much more interesting if Jack has been an unrepentant ‘bad guy’.I was also uncomfortable with King’s liberal use of the n-word. This book was not scary at all. A lot of the scares were repetitive and childish.

  Sorry to rain on the parade, but I didn't much like King's book; I really  prefer Kubrick's movie,  for which he wrote (most of, apparently) the screenplay.  In this case, Kubrick is a much better writer than the novelist. Of course, as everyone knows, the movie is different from the book, and the writing for the movie is mostly dialogue, but plot is there, too, of course.  I found the book mostly unpleasant and crude rather than scary.  I read alot of it at night, and I wasn't even slightly scared.  More like disgusted, actually. I remember one of King's short stories in a collection called""Different Seasons"" which I really liked because of his style, so I was surprised to find his style here crude and flat rather than interesting even though the situation would seem to give a writer a chance to really get into his book in a very interesting way since one of the main (maybe THE main?) characters, Jack, is a writer. I really think King has written FAR too much, unless he's just a commercial entertainer, which is fine, in which case, we should  consider him more of a story teller than a writer, but that could be a pretentious attitude, so let's just say that you either like him or...

  Admittedly my first King novel and I was definitely apprehensive. Not my typical genre. All I can saw was I did enjoy this (if that is a proper description). Truly liked Kings writing. I am always impressed when an author can paint a picture with words that I can out myself right in the scene.The story was engaging. The suspense as much psychological instead of gratuitous violence. Yes there is violence but the thriller suspense is more emotional and psychological than anything.There are many interpretations as to what lies beneath the story. In the end it’s a thriller, a fight of evil unseen forces and the unbelievable ability to overcome the worse possible circumstances.

  The Shining is to The Haunting of Hill House and The Mask of the Red Death what a butterfly is to a caterpillar. King gave wings to the haunted house story and made it fly, without sacrificing the guts of its creepy forerunners.When desperation drives Jack Torrence to the position of caretaker for an alpine hotel during the winter off-season, he brings his beautiful wife Wendy and his adoring 5-year-old son Danny with him. The Overlook Hotel is a grandiose, antique resort high in the Colorado Rockies with a colorful history and a life of its own. Snowbound in its shell, the quick-tempered abstainer minds the boiler, renews his literary aspirations, and forges a wary but hopeful peace with his wife. Meanwhile, Danny’s psychic ability awakens a latent malevolence hungry for his power, and Jack’s brittle sobriety proves ample leverage for corruption.Every page draws the reader deeper. Danny’s precognitive dreams provide delicious foreshadowing, wavering at the rim of spoilers, and the surprise addition of the lovable cook Dick Hallorann to the central cast enriches the story with southern flavor and selfless sacrifice in the face of racism. Jack is far from the lunatic of Kubrick’s movie rendition: he is a flawed but loving family man fighting himself for redemption, reminiscent of Anakin Skywalker. Wendy arises as a keen and formidable protective force for her son. The surreal atmosphere is enriched by the dispassionate menace of wasps, animated hedge art, a creepy clock, and ghostly celebrants (nod to Poe). Even the iconic weapon wielded by the monster of Danny’s dreams fascinates with novelty.All this culminates in an ending both unpredictable and satisfying, organically concluding the story while revealing a glimpse of its deep metaphysical roots. King takes us beyond the filmy perceptual curtain of the “real world” into a rich supernatural landscape of cosmic proportions, inhabited by immense psychic fauna unimaginable within our stunted worldview. Confronted and confounded, we are left with a single deduction to guide our path forward: ”That’s your job in this hard world, to keep your love alive and see that you get on, no matter what. Pull your act together and just go on.”

  I first read The Shining when it was originally published. Over the years I have replaced the hard cover with paperback, then on audiobook, then on Kindle. It’s one of the books by Stephen King that, obviously, I reread often.  I’ve watched both the Kubrick movie (which I hated at first, but can now watch with enjoyment by simply realizing his vision only used the book title and characters’ names as a launchpad without it actually being a film version of the book) and the made for TV movie (which follows the book faithfully and many people don’t appreciate). I expect to reread (and rewatch) The Shining many times more and I expect I will enjoy it just as much as I did originally.I can’t imagine that there are many people who haven’t read the book, at least King fans and horror fiction readers, but if for some reason you are out there, give yourselves a treat and read the book. Whether you decide it was a story of psychological deterioration or a true haunting, it will hold your attention and put some fascinating pictures in your head. Enjoy!

  I had read The Shining immediately when it came out in paperback in the mid 70's.  It is truly, honestly the most horrifying book I've ever read.I had high hopes for Kubrick's adaptation in 1979,  but at the time, I wasn't impressed with the film. (I was 18 years old, so what)? It missed some of the more heartbreaking details of the novel and it immediately turned into a big disappointment for me and I WAS PISSED OFF ABOUT IT!!!  WHY, did one of my favorite Directors of ALL TIME, MESS with such a perfect horror story??? Time has since ""mellowed"" me on this subject, and I see what Kubrick had in mind for HIS version of it.  I consider the film to be one of the best horror movies ever made, but the book, THIS NOVEL is extraordinary!It dives so deep into Jack Torrance and why he collapsed the way he did. It focused on Danny, and Tony showing and warning him of things to come. Without spoiling the original story, Jack gets away with a hell of a lot more gory behavior and exhibits physical pain on his wife and young son in King's story. In this book, we don't have any scenes with an axe breaking through a bathroom door. It's a much more simple and demonic implement that Jack uses to cause pain and suffering to Wendy and Danny! And when Stephen King describes it through Danny's eyes, the horror becomes almost incomprehensible and leaves you with a sick ringing tone in your ears!I'm not kidding when I said it was the most horrifying book I've ever read!  He is the Master of Horror! For ALL fans of the film, READ THE BOOK! It gets to the core of what King wanted you to feel! Some of the chapters are SO HEARTBREAKING, like when Jack briefly comes to his senses and tells Danny to ""Run DOC! Run as fast as you can!"" and then turns into the monster he really is by screaming ""Come out and take your medicine, LIKE A MAN!""  Seriously horrifying stuff!!

  This was a lie through and through. Not one bit of the description was accurate. First it was in horrendous condition with  stains, rips and other blemishes. The add said 1st edition and specifically says NOT the book of the month club edition-which it was. Said it was signed, it wasn’t.  Said had the price of 8.95 in the jacket, it didn’t. To even TRY and charge someone $70 for that garbage is wrong in every level. How are your total ratings so high?? The tip off should have been after I hit purchase, 1 left in stock...and right away I saw another seller with a WORD FOR WORD description of the same item, 1 left....at least I got the refund.

  When things happen in this book, it's really good! But... a lot of it is really boring background and exposition that doesn't really matter and it just plan boring. Maybe this is just my Gen-Z brain that is used to ultra-violence and blood and gore, but I found most parts of this book quite boring. BUT, when events do actually happen in this book it's hard to turn away, it really is good, but only when you hit the last 200-100 pages.

  This book was my first experience with Stephen King, and I have appreciated his work ever since.  I strongly recommend it at as introduction to his work, along with its sequel, Doctor Sleep.  An effective story and hard to believe it was one of King's first books.  But then, what do you expect from an author whose first published book was Carrie?
"
"
  Not even close to what is advertised by this seller. Book is in fair to good condition but has obviously been read multiple times and has strong wear on the binding.  Is not first edition, is book club edition with a completely different gutter code of S19, not R49 as advertised. Book is not signed as stated and has had a name written in the front cover covered up with a cheap Avery sticker. I kinda figured this was all too good to be true in the advertisement and it was. Still a nice book for the collection but do not fall for the sellers BS on this one. Remember if it’s too good to be true it probably is. I’ll be keeping it as it is a neat conversation piece and I do love the book, but this seller is particularly full of it.

  Redrum. It must be one of those words that can send an instant chill along your spine, especially said aloud by a five year old child, first wonderingly, then grimly, and, at last, with an adult understanding. If you think you know darkness, think again. The scariest monsters are not the ones that look ugly and brandish their claws, attempting to make us into a tasty breakfast. The scariest monsters are the ones that live inside us. That part that is capable of hurting people, hurting those we love. This is the real hair-raising stuff, this is the stuff of nightmares. This is what THE SHINING is about, about facing a deeply rooted horror of ourselves, of what we are capable, in the creepiest corners of our soul. Where does it come from? What does it feed on? How does one understand it? How does one get rid of it? Is it possible to get rid of it? Perhaps is has to be there, always, to counterbalance our other side, our loving side, the one that we are proud of and like to parade to family and friends, like to look upon in the mirror? Can one answer these questions? Stephen King tried, and I admire him for it. THE SHINING only looks like a horror story on the surface, but it's a story about pain we all go through, a story about search and doubt, and, ultimately, a story about yearning for love.Jack Torrance is out of work again. He's got issues, he's got issues big time, drinking issues, but he is over them. He thinks he's over them. He really wants to believe that. And he gets a job, thank God, he gets a job, as a hotel caretaker. The hotel happens to be a spectacular establishment by the name of Outlook tucked away in Colorado mountains and virtually unreachable during winter months. You can perhaps imagine the rest. That's right. A man, his wife, and their 5 year old son, Danny, get snowed in, in a gigantic empty building that echoes of the past, only those are not simple echoes. Danny possesses a special talent, ""the shine"", as the hotel's cook Hallorann calls it, when they meet upon Danny's arrival and Hallorann's departure. Danny sees things, Danny hears things, and those are terrible things. They are frightening and real, but Danny doesn't want to ruin the peace between his Mommy and Daddy, who, at last, are on the path of reuniting, of finding love for each other again. Only Danny should tell them, because the hotel is stirring, slowly, and everything seems to be leading to a disaster, leaving the cut off from the world family in mortal danger.What else can I say? It's brilliant. Simply brilliant. I will probably reread this book many times, to pick up on a new nuance or story layer each time I dip my head into the horror of THE SHINING.

  This may be my new all time favorite novel - Salem's Lot currently holds that spot but I have to back and re-read it.This book genuinely freaked me out a few times. This is king at his best where his writing feels like your reading something that actually happened. I really hope fans of the movie will read this as well as it's just so much better (and ACTUALLY ABOUT THE SHINING).You will find out who Danny's imaginary friend Tony is and it's such a huge, pleasing reveal. Just so much I can keep saying about this book but I would just end up saying too much. I've been thinking about this one since I completed it almost a month ago.

  I read this book in the ninth grade and loved it so much. I purchased it again as a refresher before diving into Dr Sleep. I must say I’m a little disappointed. I don’t remember it being so slow the first read ( but granted that was 38 years ago) and I some how along the way confused the book and the movie( Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation) There are fundamental differences which are pretty important. All in all I’m glad I read it again because I feel ready to start reading Dr Sleep now. It’s a 3 1/2 star read for me because of the slow paced narrative BUT the scares are fantastic and King’s writing is phenomenal

  I came fresh from finishing King's memoir On Writing, where he gave some, uh, colorful advice on the craft. Probably my favorite was his prescription against plotting. The basis of cogent storytelling he just chucks into the blue lagoon.Authors have the right to enjoy writing, and to show it. You can definitely feel that King enjoyed writing a lot of this. But as King writes how Danny's feet ""whisper"" on heavy carpet twice, sandwiched between digressions and regressions and thought patterns and Excedrin tablets coming from every which way, you notice how he enjoys it a bit too much. The Shining: The Novel is unbearably uneventful until it's not. Every page turn is agonizing, and I just wanted it all to be over.I want to hold onto the hope that the dizzyingly high number of adaptations of his work come from the recognition I had after now having read two of his works—that Stephen Edwin King is a factory of really solid ideas that threaten to fall apart the minute they're grazed by his wobbly prose style and religious indifference to plotting before they're scooped by arguably more talented and artistically acute storytellers into widely celebrated film and TV adaptations.King is Hollywood's godsend. A literal film treatment factory. Praise be upon him.

  www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com Read from March 01 to 20, 2015I'm not sure why I only saw the movie and never read the book. I loved the movie so much it makes no sense, but back in the day, not many things make sense to me.I will have to go back and watch the movie again to see all of the different little changes. Now I know why some things happened. You know those things, the little things that are only in the head, written in the book, but doesn't show up in the movie part. Wow! I know the book messed with my head but I didn't realize it would make me write that way! I hope anyone reading this can understand what I meant.I don't like to write spoilers about a book if I can help it so I guess this will be a short review.There are so many questions I have about the book versus the movie but I will have to leave that to the book group.I really did enjoy the book, although I did feel a bit crazier than I am at times with all of the voices in everyone's head! :)I didn't want one of the bad things that happened in the movie to NOT happen in the book. I didn't want to read that part and lo and behold, it didn't happen! Yay!The ending in the book was a lot better than the movie. Once again, I really did enjoy this book and look forward to reading and re-reading more of the golden oldies!

  I have only been reading Stephen King a couple of years now, and imagine that most of you may already have settled opinions about his work one way or the other.  I am not a horror fan, in general, but  find King's characters well developed and his narratives compelling. I actually read the entire Dark Tower series first. I liked some parts of this series a lot, found other parts self indulgent (King writes himself into the series if you don't know) or needlessly baroque, but overall good enough that after I recovered from that reading marathon I eventually started reading some of his other books that I had acquired in my years of thrift shop and garage sale book compulsiveness.  I read Doctor Sleep first, really enjoyed it, and after some time decided to actually buy the Shining to see how Dan Torrance got to be the way he was. Of course, if you have the choice, I recommend reading the Shining first - but arguably Doctor Sleep is a better book.

  I went into this book slightly ashamed that I, as an avid reader, hadn't read it (or more Steven King, for that matter), and even more ashamed to admit that I've never seen the movie.  When people find out that I'm reading the book, the first question they ask is typically, ""Which is better -- the book or the movie..??!"" Once I tell them I've never seen the movie, most people want to know how that's possible.  I admit - I HAVE seen a couple of scenes of the movie, somehow.. (Maybe through clips from commercials, tv shows, or movies..?)Other than Jack Nicholson holding an axe yelling, ""Here's Johnny!"" in one scene, and typing on the keyboard, ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" in another, I knew nothing about the movie or book going into this. First, neither of those parts were in the book. Second, I'm a huge wuss, but if the movie is anything like the book, no wonder people go on and on about it! I couldn't read this book at night or when I was home alone because this book creeped me out too much. While I don't typically like horror movies (I HATE when people pop out of nowhere), this book just builds up and builds up the suspense and horror aspects. I wish more horror movies were like this book, building up the suspense slowly instead of the cheap scares when the audience screams just because a killer jumped out suddenly.The book focuses on Jack and Wendy Torrance and their 5-year-old son Danny as they spend the winter alone in The Overlook Hotel, a beautiful lodge where Jack is serving as caretaker during the off season after losing his teaching gig. The first couple of chapters of this book took some slogging through for me, but after the Torrances were settled in at The Overlook, I was hooked! The name of the book comes from Danny's psychic gift, which someone dubs ""the shine"". Unfortunately, Danny's shine is super powerful, even though he's only 5, and he sees future occurrences, sees/hears ghosts and spirits, and can read people's thoughts. The Overlook is apparently a hotbed of spirits and ghosts that start to influence Jack, and it all goes downhill from there for the family. Suspenseful and creepy, this book also contains great storytelling and character development.

  Jack, his wife Wendy, and their son Danny were the main characters. Since I’ve watched the movie, I could see them clearly in my head, especially the red sweatshirt with the zipper. I could hear their tone of voice and see their mannerisms. The book had it’s funny moments; I enjoyed the sarcastic wit, especially coming from Jack.My favorite lines: 1) “During our first winter I hired a family instead of a single man. There was a tragedy. A horrible tragedy.” 2) “That was when they were just startin out here and that fat ** Ullman, he woulda hired the Boston Strangler if he’d’ve worked for minimum wage.” 3) “It’s a pity the things you see when you ain’t got a gun.” 4) May 12th. Not a day earlier or later.At the beginning, the story really went into depth about Jack’s temper and how he used to be a drunk. There was also a lot of foreshadowing that something dreadful would happen. When I heard about Delbert Grady, I figured it was foreshadowing what’s to come for the Torrance family! The story needed this foreshadowing because it started off really, really slow. Things didn’t pick up until the dead wasps came back to life and stung Danny in his room.I really enjoyed Halloran’s bond with Danny at the Overlook Hotel. He was leaving for Florida but also had the shine (could read thoughts). He warned Danny about the hauntings. I was completely terrified about Room 217, Tony (Danny’s imaginary friend), and REDRUM REDRUM REDRUM!!!!Imagine being isolated up in the mountains trapped in a snowstorm. The radio’s broken. Only you and your family. No way to get up the hill if you needed rescued. Slowly, your daddy is losing his mind. The ending when the hotel seems to come to life in the form of a party and Jack is after Danny and Wendy with the intent to kill, I had chills down my spine. Let’s just say, I had to sleep with a night light! The slow build up was definitely worth the ending outcome!I RECOMMEND this book to read.

  This was a reread for me in anticipation of DOCTOR SLEEP.  I’ve only read THE SHINING one other time, and it was at least 10 years ago. And I honestly had no recollection of it at all…the movie version was much clearer in my mind even though it has been at least as long since as I watched it.Since I don’t often reread a book, I was happy going into THE SHINING with no previous memory of it, it was as though I was reading for the first time!I now remember why THE SHINING is one of my favorite King books. It has everything you could want in a horror book (everything I want anyway). Ghosts, blood, murder, creepiness!Probably the creepiest part for me was that Danny Torrance is only five years old…my own son is almost five, and I couldn’t imagine him having an imaginary friend such as Tony or having to live with an alcoholic father, having his arm broken at three years old, or just dealing with all the ghosts at the Overlook Hotel and his special ability!Overall, I really enjoyed my reread of THE SHINING! I started DOCTOR SLEEP immediately now that Danny’s story continues on paper and not just in King’s mind!It is hard to believe that Stephen King wrote THE SHINING at the height of his own battle with alcohol. I’m not sure I could be so articulate in the same circumstances.  I now need to revisit some of King’s other earlier books to see if my feelings have changed over the years.While not your typical scary horror book, I think enough is left out there for your mind to run away with itself. I already don’t like elevators, especially old ones, so when the ancient elevator at the Overlook begins to move on its own…well I started thinking all kinds of things. Another example would be the animal topiary…I just think this is creepy in the first place, why do you need to do this? So when they come to life…!!Even though I don’t remember much of reading THE SHINING the first time around, I must have enjoyed it just as much otherwise I would never have considered a reread.  And I will likely read it again and again!

  Woah...this book was scary! Not that I'm probably telling anybody anything they don't know, but I just feel like I can't say it enough. I read it in October because I wanted a good scare for Halloween, and that is exactly what I got, and boy, was it fantastic?!I have just 2 complaints, the 1st of which being that at one point in the book, Danny knows the word ""abrogated"" (which means repeal or do away with...I had to look it up), but he calls the Presidential Suite, the Presidential ""Sweet"". Now, I know his parents never ""talked down"" to him, but I still wonder how he would know how to use abrogated. But in the overall excellence of the book, I really feel this is more of a minor point than a major one.The second of which being that the parts in parentheses were somewhat distracting. And apparently the Kindle edition was not converted as well as it should have been, because parts that were supposed to be in quotations inside parentheses were not...instead they were surrounded by question marks or exclamation points. And because of the parts in parentheses in general, I often found myself going back to the original sentence to catch up with what it should be saying.For the scariness factor, I really expected the book to be a nonstop scare-fest. Which, of course, it wasn't. Up until somewhere probably around 70% or so, there were just little pockets of terror...which I realize were just preparing me for the scare-fest to come. And it was glorious! Once it started, I simply could not stop reading...I was like a woman possessed. I HAD to know what was going to happen. It felt like the fate of the characters depended on my continuing to read.Overall, I loved this book!! I loved Danny's character...he was very interesting, and quite an amazing little boy. But still vulnerable at times, which I think is important. And I liked Wendy, too, though I think she should have just divorced Jack outright. But then we wouldn't have had a story, either. I thought Jack was terrible. And maybe that's unfair, all things considered, but I just couldn't bring myself to like him.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good scare. It provides a great story and a great scare all in one package.

  King is one of the most prolific writers of not only suspense / horror, but in all genres.  His writing is so descriptive that you can see each blade of grass or smell the ocean as the protagonists and / antagonists do.  He has a way of magically transporting the reader into the story.  The Shining is about a recovering down-on-his-luck school teacher who is an aspiring playwright.  He takes on the job of caretaker of a huge old resort hotel during the off season as a last resort to provide for his family.  What he doesn't know is that the hotel is also a warehouse of old spirits, many of whom have died violently.  The caretaker, John Torrance, has a son Danny who is gifted with ESP, Telepathy, can see images from the past and can foresee into the future.  He is just a child but has amazingly strong powers, called the ""shining"" , and the hotel wants them.  The evil hotel spirits eventually possess the body of John Torrance and attempt to turn him into a homicidal maniac.  The hotel wants to come back to life and the only way to accomplish this is if they have Danny's powers.  But there's only one way to get those powers.

  I already loved the book, but I had read it so long ago as a teen I forgot the meat of it.  I'm loving reading it on my Kindle Fire and in a way that doesn't exacerbate my pain issues (because the book itself was always so heavy).I forgot how important long backstory can be.  If you want to jump right into the scary action, well, this isn't that kind of book.  The early on parts of the book are still important and maybe they're scarier to me now and therefore will be more memorable because this time around I'm married and have children.  The book is already having more of an effect on me before they've even gotten to the hotel.  I guess my point is that it's scary still, but not for the same reasons it was 20 years ago.  And that's ok.  [It's because I have children now.  The emotional perspective of being a mother gives me a whole new perspective.  The emotional perspective of being a wife does too.I'll be honest about why I'm rereading it too... I think it's important because it's been so long since my last reading and I'm about to read the sequel Doctor Sleep.  I started reading Doctor Sleep and realized that I didn't remember quite enough of the original story to feel that I knew the characters well enough any more.  I couldn't connect as well with them and their experiences.]

  Read this 40 years ago when it first was published.  Then, it was the scariest book Id ever read! Still frightening today, but between then (1975?) and now (2015), I've seen the Kubrick film several times and he put a slightly different spin on the story.  While I typically like a book better than the movie version, I feel that Kubrick made some changes that were superior to the book (i.e., a Maze instead of Hedge Animals, twin girl ghosts instead of the ""thing"" in the playground concrete tunnel, Jack's obsessively typing ""all work & no play.."", Halloween's fate, etc.).  Although Shelley Duvall's Wendy was truly obnoxious. Halfway through the film, I was hoping she would be an early casualty, LOL.Main thing I find distracting in the book is that Danny's inner dialogue sounds like a mature adult much the time, and not  like the 5-year old he's supposed to be.  Well-drawn believable characters & sense of impending terror.  All in all, rereading the book now still gave me chills and it reminded me of how ""elegant"" & ""to-the-point"" King's early writing was. Just reread Salems Lot, too, and that was fabulous!

  God, I love The Shining. It’s been about five years since I last read it, so I wanted to refresh myself before I jumped into Doctor Sleep. Even though I’m sure King insulated the long-awaited sequel with enough background info that you’re not required to read The Shining to understand it. Eh, call me a traditionalist. I like to read the first book first.Anyway, after rereading, I now remember what it was about the book I liked so much: everything.Let’s start with the characterization. King is a master of characterization in this book. He jumps POVs a lot, and yet you always know whose head you’re head. Every POV has its own distinct voice, and each one is done fantastically. All their personalities are clearly built from their past experiences, are consistent, are interesting. There’s nothing about King’s characters I don’t like in this novel. And my favorite character of all? The Overlook, of course. For a building, it’s certainly got some attitude. And pure, unapologetic malice.Now, the plot. This is a long book, as evidenced by the fact it took me forever to read. I could have plowed through three more of The Dresden Files in the time it took me to reread this sucker, but you know what? It deserved every page. There’s always something going on in the story — there’s never a lull — even when what’s happening seems, on the surface, mundane. Everything ties so expertly together as the story progresses that the sheer level of interconnectedness kind of blows my mind. (As you’re aware, my major weakness is plotting, so great plots often leave me in awe.)How about we talk about the horror. Oh, the horror. When I first read this book, it scared the crap out of me. I don’t typically read (or watch) horror, but King has always been an exception. Because he’s Stephen King, you know? And when I first tiptoed my way through The Shining, I almost scared myself silly. This time around, I knew what was coming, so I wasn’t nearly as disturbed as I was half a decade ago. And this was a good thing because it gave me the power to see the massive amount of subtle horror embedded beneath the overt, in-your-face horror. Like I said, this book has a lot of layers, and they’re all very complex. I was even more impressed this time around with how well King connected the family drama and the horror, with how complex his horror in and of itself is.

  I originally saw the movie version of The Shining when it first came out. Over the years, I have watched that movie a number of times - each time I see something I missed.But, the book is absolutely amazing. The detail is incredible, although I have to admit that as I read it, I saw Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall at times as I read some of the chapters. But, there is enough material that Stanley Kubrick was not able to carry to the movie that this was seldom. Stephen King's ability, even in his early books, at character development is outstanding. From Jack Torrence all of the way down to bit characters like Stuart Ullman, you get a great sense of just who they are.I found that the character of Danny Torrence in the book to be different from the movie. In the movie, he was an eight year old with his ability to ""shine"". But, in the book you are in his head. And, for an eight year old, he he well beyond his years. There were times where I saw him as a scared eight year old. But, at other times in the book, as you read his thoughts, he was very deep and complex.King brought the hotel, The Overlook, to life like no movie can.If I said any more, it would mean spoilers, which I try to avoid as much as possible. Just understand this - The Shining is probably one of the most widely watched movies in the United States. But, to fully understand the complexity of the story, you must read the book. It was very enjoyable.

  NO SPOILERSI had never really considered reading a Stephen King book before I started the sample chapters from The Shining a few weeks ago, but I'm glad I decided to give him a try.  I had just finished reading all five Song of Ice and Fire books before The Shining, so I was looking for a writing style that could compete with and keep me as entertained as George RR Martin's style.  King is truly a talented, brilliant writer.  I will say that I expected more 'horror' from this book in the traditional sense, but there is enough suspense to keep the reader captivated.  King's writing is detailed and incredibly descriptive.  He firmly establishes a persona for each character, and I was able to develop an empathetic connection to each.  Of course I couldn't NOT picture Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, but the book is so much more than the movie.  From my recollection, the Kubrick film not only skips an enormous amount of detail, it also changes the story in a few key areas.  This is truly an outstanding read, and I will definitely read more by King in the future.
"

  King is undoubtedly a skilled writer.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Shinning.  My only not-so-positive remark is that the novel focuses too much on violence and vulgarity.  Not that I'm sensitive to either, but after seeing the movie, (which is more reserved and uses eerie stillnesses and anticipation), I think focusing so much on either is unnecessary and almost counteracts the scariness of the isolation and how it slowly ""suffocates"" everyone.
"
"
  The book has scenes for Danny that warrant calling it ""The Shining"" that I feel were undervalued and unused by Kubrick when making the film. The Danny centered scenes are some of the scariest moments. Jack's also a lot more likeable than in the film. The physical book itself was also pretty decent quality. I read paperbacks pretty hard and the spine on my copy didn't sustain a single wear line. I grew up with the movie and the book is now one of my favorites.
"
"
  This is the most horrifying engulfing tale of terror from Stephen King that I have ever had the privilege of reading. The most alarming and hideous aspect being that King writes all of the characters in a way that I can identify my personal internal structure to almost every aspect of each character's personality and thought pattern. I could not put this book down nor can I walk thru my home without switching on every light in every room. This book consumed my every free moment and I found during my working day I was dreamily existing inside this universe of horror. The only downside to this is that it ended. Luckily, King wrote a sequel in 2009 following Danny's adult life called ""Doctor Sleep"". I will be ordering this as soon as I finish writing this review. In my humble opinion, this is the best book I have ever read, to date, by the master Stephen King. A ""MUST READ"" for all Stephen King fans!
"
"
  This extraordinary tale of the supernatural opens with arguably the second most famous sentence in the history of western literature:  ""Jack Torrance thought:  Officious little prick"".  Obviously this is meant to offend or entrap the reader, and it does, but the comment is not entirely out of context of the character of Jack Torrance once you get to know him .  By the end of part one, we know that he is susceptible to violence, alcoholism and depression.  We also know that the Overlook Hotel - the location of the story itself - has had a particularly violent and gruesome history.  We know that Danny Torrance - son of Jack and Wendy - is gifted (or cursed) with the ability to witness events before they happen.  This is unfortunate for one so young, and yet in this context, this ability may turn out to be a blessing for him to witness events that he does not fully comprehend.As the story progresses, Mr King prefers to hint at significant features of the tale, leading the reader to guess this, or guess that, instead of simply telling the reader what he  wants them to know.  Suspense therefore builds slowly but surely and each page is turned by the reader not just with apprehension of what you know is sure to come, but with a sense of absolute joy in the knowledge that you have placed the next four or five hours of your life in the hands of a master.  And when it comes to The Overlook Hotel, the mind boggles.In summary, then:  Is THE SHINING Stephen King's finest work?  You need to read the book yourself to answer that question. Certainly, one could say CHRISTINE was the greater accomplishment - in it, Mr King made the absurd totally believable (and therefore terrifying).  But with THE SHINING he has turned the everyday, run of the mill ghost story into one of the scariest reading experiences you could ever hope to find.  Reading THE SHINING is like going on an infinite DARE-DOUBLE DARE competition with the devil.  You read one chapter, and then another but then you ask yourself, one more?  one more?  Will i be able to cope with one more?Go on and test yourself, then.  You know you want to.

  I have seen the movie ""The Shining,"" but have never read the book.  The book, of course, is 10 times better!  I think this is Stephen King's most suspenseful book!  It is much different than the movie in parts, but the storyline is very similar.  Very well written, as all of Stephen King's books are.  I would very much recommend this book to anyone wanting a great psychological, suspenseful, thriller to read.  A definite page-turner for sure!!

  When most people think of the shining they often think back to the movie with Jack Nicholson in it. While the movie was fantastic this book is so much better and goes into so many more details and really brings a hotel to life. Such a great read King doesn’t fail oft when most people think of the shining they often think back to the movie with Jack Nicholson in it. While the movie was fantastic this book is so much better and goes into so many more details and really brings a hotel to life. Such a great read.  King really knows how to suck you and with character development a great story and an exciting finish.

  I had read this book not long after seeing the movie and was frightened by it probably due to the image of Jack Nicholson's descent into madness from the movie. I was determined to reread it when I heard of Stephen King's sequel, Doctor Sleep. I was surprised to see completely different aspects of the story that in my youth I had missed. The struggle of Jack Torrance with his desire to provide for and protect his family while dealing with his new found sobriety and the increasing and manipulative voices of the Overlook Hotel's ghostly residents. Wendy Torrance's struggle not to become her mother, her distrust and hatred of her husband and her fear of her son's special abilities. Poor little Danny Torrance, dealing with his ""shining"" abilities while trying to fight the hotel's evil forces who want him to become a permanent resident. Three mixed-up people snowbound in the Rockies for the winter which could probably make the sanest person insane. I felt more connected to this book than I did years ago, an unwilling silent observer to the events in the Overlook Hotel. I'm haunted by thoughts of what I would do in their places and in similar situations. I know this is a novel but the beauty of Stephen King's best novels are the connection you feel with the characters almost as if you're suffering right along side of them. Perhaps I will have to reread more of Stephen King's earlier works to see what I may have missed.

  Stephen King's The ShiningI thought I was familiar with this story when I watched the Jack Nicholson film many years ago, but I was totally wrong!The book is about Danny, which the Kubrick film (although well-made) completely misses.  Danny is the most powerful psychic in these parts and the kid broadcasts out like crazy.  He can read minds but still has a little kid's attitude and does not have the maturity to handle such a gift (or curse?).Jack was a teacher but also loved binge drinking with his buddy Al.  One day they ran into a bike on the road.  No person on it, just a bike.  They both have an epiphany that they need to go cold turkey.  How the bike arrived there is not explained, but is probably something Danny put there?Fascinating workings of Jack's mind throughout - his alcoholism, his fits of violence, and a few pages devoted to his father who, like Jack, did some pretty damaging things to his family.The Overlook is a summer resort hotel with a mysterious past.  Jack gets a job there as a caretaker and finds that the previous one killed his family and then himself.  Not gonna happen to him though.  OK!And Wendy, which character seems very weak-willed and only turns on the guns when her motherly instincts turn on.  The story is grerat when I have to yell at the book for Wendy to not go into the hall!  And how can she carry a knife and not use it while Jacks beats on her?History and HysteriaLoved the Overlook's mysterious parts - the woman in the bathtub, the 70 years of haunts floating through the halls, the mysterious barkeep who fuels up Jack into fits of rage and to prove Jack is in fact managerial material.Finally King's black cook, Dick Hallorann, a man who shines but not nearly as much as Danny.  Disappointing as I was hoping for a white horse riding in and saving the day.  They were lucky to get away with their lives.Bottom Line:Horror, when done right, is fast-paced and takes your breath away.  King does this in spades.Can't wait for Doctor Sleep!

  I saw The Shining many years ago.  It left quite an impression.  Enough so that I could immediately spot where the filmmakers took artistic license to the extreme.  I'm surprised that I'm going to say this, but thank god they did.  I might feel differently if it wasn't for the hedge animals in the book.  I can suspend disbelief for a lot, but that was too big a stretch for me.  It was so distracting that it affected my rating as well.  I hope Doctor Sleep is better

  How can you not own a copy of The Shining? No other horror novel of its time addressed the terrors of alcoholism in a haunted hotel story and chilled the reader's spine too? Stephen King did for dead women in bathtubs what Poe did for bodies hidden in the cellar, or Robert Bloch did for creepy shower scenes. If you ""watched the movie"" the end of the book is scary in its own way. It has always been my opinion Stanley Kubrick never wanted to ruin the end of the book, and for that I am grateful. You will be too.

  I have loved Stephen King since I was about 13 years old and got my paws on a copy of Christine without my parents noticing.  For some reason I never got around to reading The Shining, but made a point of reading it when Doctor Sleep came out.  I really wanted to read The Shining before I read the sequel Doctor Sleep since several people told me that while Doctor Sleep can be read as a standalone, reading it after reading The Shining would increase my enjoyment.I am glad I paid attention to the advice of another reviewer. The Shining is a great, classic, Stephen King novel.From the first chapter I found myself caring about the Torrance family and dying to read more about The Overlook.  I almost could not stop reading, and the only times I did take a break was when I was home alone and started terrifying myself.  The fact that my grown up self had to take a break to de-scare was great since it has been a LONG time since any book so thoroughly gave me the chills.The pacing was great with an almost ominous terror building with each page.  Even though I knew how the story ended, I was still on the edge of my seat cringing with every setback or new outburst.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a genuinely scary read and I especially recommend this book to anyone who has to date only seen the movie or miniseries adaptions.

  I have to say that it's rare that I find a movie better than it's book.  I think this is one but the book is still worth 5 stars.  The movie was such a psycho-horror that I can't watch it alone.  The book is  so much more detailed that  it can sometimes work against the horror of the story in my own mind.  The book is very long.  Which is great for those who love long slow  character  development.  Excellent writing.

  I read The Shining in the Spanish version in the early eighties during a family holiday and I thought it was terrifying.  I was in my early teens and it was one of the first full-length adult novels I had read.  Later, when I saw the movie version I was disappointed.  Although the hotel in the movie was pretty it had not the magnificent grandeur I had imagined.  Also, the orange, yellow and black carpet was wrong and the elaborate wallpaper was missing.  I was not surprised to miss the hedge animals and see them replaced by a maze.  Surely the hedge animal scenes would not have been realistic, given the limitations of F/X at the time.  Danny Lloyd was great as Danny Torrance, Jack Nicholson of course was excellent as Jack Torrance, whereas Shelly Duval was not as good-looking as I had imagined Wendy Torrance.I have just read the English version and enjoyed it very much.  Whereas as a teenager I had focused more on the predicaments of Danny and the gory bits, as an adult I remarked on the existential conflicts of the Torrances and the consequences of their complex relationships with their respective parents.  The melancholy sense of a place where the past is always present was also appealling at this stage.  Another bonus is that (like most other King work) The Shining is a virtual time capsule of American popular music, TV commercials and brands.  I never knew what Doctor Dentons were until I read about them in The Shining, and the music everyone listens to is a good summary of the late disco era.  The notion of a child's soul being trapped forever in a playground, to be tortured forever by a malignant presence, was scary 30+ years ago, but now is more pitiful than scary.The Shining bears re-reading.  I think it is a better work than The Stand, which for some reason is viewed as King's magnum opus. Now I'm annoyed because in the movie someone says that The Overlook Hotel was built on an Indian burial ground, thus muddying the waters with Pet Sematary.  Needless to say, King uses no such subterfuge to explain how The Overlook came to be.  He doesn't have to.

  Before I read King I had assumed he was an overrated, bloated author that had way too many movie adaptations of his works--in fact he has the Guinness World Record for most film adaptations of all time (no surprise). Then I read his `On Writing' book (because I am an aspiring fiction/horror writer) and I learned a lot. Big deal though, whoopie do, I still wasn't interested in his stuff . . . but something kept on nagging and nagging at me . . . something dark and tall; it was The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. I cannot explain why; maybe it's because the book I was writing at the time seemed like it would benefit itself if I, my book's Writer, would step outside my comfort zone (Crichton, McCarthy, Matheson, Barker) and just try to read The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. I finally read it because the cover looked sweet, not gonna lie. The ever-binding, story-interweaving Todash Darkness pulled me into the world of King. For instance, the Turtle is in It, and even mentioned in his most recent 11/22/63; and Todash Darkness--that vague conceptual, slightly existentialistic evil that makes a sound like rumbling chimes--which is also mentioned in ""It""; and then there's Randal Flagg, Donald Callahan, Ted Brautigan, the Low Men and the Crimson King: all the former are uniting elements in many Stephen King books. And The Dark Tower series is a gateway drug to his other novels; and his other novels are a gateway drug to The Dark Tower--it's full circle, baby! But let's talk about The Shining, shall we, because that's why you're reading this. In his introduction for the novel King says that the decision to write (and how to write) The Shining was very crucial in terms of his career as a writer. You must understand that Carrie did not break any rules besides (this one)  and it was very short, which is ideal for debut novels for any author. It was also original and shocking; another must-have. But Carrie wasn't necessarily epic or long lasting. Then `Salem's Lot was his second. He took risks with style, but nothing else; the pacing was fast, and he didn't get too deep into character history. What you knew about most of the characters were through immediate actions and thoughts. And the town itself was something he was familiar with, along with the people and the professions of the people. It was marketable. It worked. It was filmable. Then The Shining was written more of a character study about how alcoholism destroys marriages and relationships between fathers and their children. Most of the horror wasn't shown on a golden platter as it was in Carrie and `Salem's Lot; instead, the horror was suggestive. It was there, in the shadows, you could choose to see it or ignore it; it was subtle, but there. Then toward the end, that's when the fireworks begin to go off one after the other . . . but still, for my generation (twenty-somethings) and younger, many will pass up The Shining just because it takes a while to pick up the pace and, hey, there's a movie, too--Jack Nicholson's in it, so they'll just watch that, assuming that they'll get the ""same thing out of it""--which is a shame. Ultimately this was King's attempt to actually write a literarily respectable novel with horror aspects (and he does stay true to horror; it's just not blood and guts all the time). I won't waste your time with the synopsis; the book is different than the film, but it's not that different and I can't say how it is even if I wanted to (which I don't), because the differences would be spoilers. It's a little scarier than Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation in principles and it had a better story; but the movie is easier to watch. However, if you don't mind a slower paced novel that builds up like tension from a rope being pulled further and further apart until it snaps like a stale jerky, then you should definitely read The Shining--and then make sure you read The Dark Tower series (at least the first four are phenomenal).

  “The Shining” is a 1977 horror story that Stephen King wrote early in his career, and Stanley Kubrick later made it into a movie in 1980 starring Jack Nicholson.  I’ve seen bits of the movie and recognize the famous “Here’s Johnny!” line from Nicholson, which isn’t in the written version, but I haven’t ever read the book.  In the spirit of scary things around Halloween, I thought I would give it and the sequel, “Dr. Sleep” a read.I always wondered about the title of the book, and I was happy to find out that King defines it in one of the opening chapters.  This was a fast-paced story that touches on the terrible effects of alcoholism and the inner demons that drunkenness can unleash.  King does a good job of unlocking those demons in the character of Jack Torrance as he struggles with sobriety and an evil force at the fictitious Overlook Hotel in Colorado.  Jack comes to find the hotel has a dark past and some of those demons work through Jack in a terrifying chain of events.I rated the story four stars because it felt like King left a few things unanswered as to the history of the hotel surrounding a reoccurring owner and the nature of Jack’s friend that was influential in Jack taking on the caretaker position at the hotel.  The story includes some frightening sequences, profanity, and graphic violence, so some readers may want to shy away from this type of story.Overall, I enjoyed the book.  It was interesting to learn about the history of the hotel and to see how King used Jack’s past alcoholism and potential relapse as a means to fuel the dark things that lurk at the Overlook Hotel.  The endings of King novels often leave me a little unsatisfied, but I thought this one tied things together well, and made for a good story!

  I got the book because I ordered Doctor Sleep, and in the first few pages realized how vastly different the book must have been from Kubrick's movie version. I cannot express how glad I am that I went back and read the original, not only before Doctor Sleep, but just in general. While there is no questioning Kubrick's genius, I now have lots of questions as to why King allowed such drastic changes from the book to the film. The book was far superior to the movie, of course, but the alterations to the main characters now seem to have been more destructive than constructive. From the mother Wendy's appearance, to the fiber of her being changed to her polar opposite on film makes no sense to me, and I am a huge fan of both artists - Kubrick & King.SPOILER ALERT:To the killing of such an integral character as Dick Halloran. The latter I find simply outrageous, now, having read the book. Missing out on the shed scene? Losing the savior? Cutting ties to Danny's later in life father figure? None of that makes sense to me, it certainly isn't worth the cheap trade- off of one brief shining moment of shock. We already knew Jack was crazy, no further proof was necessary.I like to think I have an adequate vocabulary, but I cannot remember another book that has sent me to the dictionary more frequently - gleefully, too. That was another thing that seemed lost in translation, the sheer pageantry of the grandeur King laid out at the Overlook, and for Kubrick to have been the one to trim those hedges ( literally ) will be one of the enduring mysteries of cinema, at least to me.

  First published in 1977, The Shining was only Stephen King's third book and first hardcover bestseller.  It was also his second book to feature a writer as the lead character. I was first introduced to King in the mid-90s and spent many a summer reading his books back to back. The flame was relit last year when I decided to start collecting his books in hardcover again and picking through the ones I'd missed out on over the last decade.I have to admit that The Shining is not one of my favorites.  I only chose to read it now because a sequel featuring a grown Danny is due out next fall called Doctor Sleep. As soon as I heard about it, I knew I wanted to read it but knew I needed to read The Shining first.  Now, I'm not so sure.  Of course, Doctor Sleep is sure to sell thousands upon thousands of copies and become an instant NYT bestseller.  Too bad Stanley Kubrick isn't around anymore (Kubrick directed the movie version of The Shining).Though I've never seen the movie of The Shining all the way through, I don't have to dwell too much into the book's plot to let you know what it's about.  You've either seen the movie, or know enough about it thanks to its place in pop culture to know what it is about. Though I do know Kubrick purposely changed quite a bit for the screen, chances are he made it better.In the book, King offers very little history on why the Overlook hotel is haunted, or why it has such an ominous effect over its off-season caretaker.  It's just a bad place. And though the haunted hotel is indeed the lead character driving the story, the book really isn't about the hotel at all.  It's about Jack Torrance and his son Danny.  Jack is a failing teacher, recovering alcoholic, and wanna-be writer - all traits one could use to describe King in the 70s. He was writing what he knew, no doubt.  Danny is a boy who suffers from ""the shining,"" the unique ability to see things that aren't there - sort of like a medium, but sort of different.All we really know about the hotel is that a lady killed herself in Room 217, some gangsters killed a couple of people there, and something might have gone wrong at a masked ball held there a long time ago.  Oh, and the previous caretaker killed his wife and daughters and then offed himself there, but they are not ghosts here.  That's it.  Add to this some animal shaped topiaries that move around on the lawn and will attack you, which was a pretty creepy detail, but that's it.There are some intense moments where the elevator is operating on its own or Jack hallucinates having drinks at the bar, but still no real history into the hotel despite Jack even trying to find out on his own when he comes across some documents in the basement. Ultimately, all of this somehow drives Jack insane (along with the reader), which scares his wife Wendy, and upsets little Danny. Spell murder backwards (REDRUM!) over and over and over again, and you've got yourself a book.Now, I will give King credit where it is due.  After all, this was only his third book at the time. King excels at writing good characterization.  He still does today. Right from the start, you are in Jack's head and that's where you stay as his mind spirals out of control.  And ultimately, Jack's character is what drives this book. Not Wendy. Not Danny. It's all about Jack.  And how ironic that an over-the-top actor named Jack in real life would play Jack in the movie!The story itself reminded me of some of the weaker Koontz books I've read.  Yep, Koontz.  We have a genius idea that would make one hell of a story, but only ends up letting down our expectations because the writer just didn't take us where he could have. At 600 pages, this was also King's largest book at that time.  We know from the lofty tomes he's written since then that he let us down by about 200 pages at least!So, while it is a classic and remains a part of pop culture history thanks to certain cinematic elements, I'm glad I can now say I've read it.  I will read the sequel as well next year.  But... it's not one of my King favorites when it comes to horror.

  This is not only my favorite Stephen King novel, its my favorite book, period. Hands down, bar none. I've read it 3 times & have just purchased the audio version so now its gonna be 4 times that i've taken that long car ride up into the Colorado Rockies & onto that twisting mountain road called Sidewinder Pass that'll lead me to the Overlook Hotel for another visit. And i never read a book more than once. At least not that i can remember. But this book is simply the best. I first read it when i was about 13 & at that point in time, nothing since i was about 6 or 7 yrs old had ever sacred me to the point of having to jump up outta my bed & run to turn the light off then pull the covers up over my head! But the lady in the bathtub chapter did exactly that to me! Scared the absolute crap outta me! And no lie, nothing ever scares me. I once saw years ago when Whoopie Goldberg had her own talk show where she would only have one single guest on for the whole entire hour and Shephen King was her guest. She asked him if he ever scared himself while writing any of his books and he said no, not really. The only time he did ever scare himself was when he was writing the lady in the bathtub scene for The Shining! Lol, i nearly popped when he said that and i loved him even more for it. Dam that is one scary scene and one scary book.

  Huge fan of the movie, and loved the sequel, but hadn't given King's written work much of a look until now. WOWZERS this book is great! I now have a new appreciation for the film because the book feels like a descent into madness, written in a way that is realistic - not just a ""ghost story"" but a ghost story mixed with delusions and psychotic breakdown. Everyone feels richer and fuller.

  Sometimes you'll read a book by a popular author and wonder what all the fuss is about, but occasionally you'll come across a work that proves that this writer is - or at least can be - the real deal. I do like this book better than the movie, and while the movie is praised for all the subtle subliminal touches kubrick supposedly added, I think the book is more subtle than the movie. For example, rather than the famous river of blood from the elevator seen in the movie, the book has the elevator filled with something less stereotypically horror but more effective due to the build-up. Even the mantra ""Redrum"" feels like less of a gimmick in the book because of the stronger focus on Jack Torrance's alcoholism. On the website ""cinemassacre"" the review of kubrick's ""the shining"" makes fun of the way it ""tries to scare you over nothing"" with a loud noise occurring when the word ""tuesday"" is shown. ""Oh no, not tuesday!"" jokes the reviewer James Rolfe. However in the book simple chapter titles like ""snow"" or ""tony"" do have a big emotional impact because of the places they appear and all the implication king has carefully laden those simple words with by that point in the story.The story is not without flaw, and King doesn't always know when to be subtle and when to be brutally explicit, a problem reminiscent of the roque mallet that features so prominently in the story with one end rubber and the other end hard. King's trademark habit of rambling in brackets to remind us of something else that is scary and related to the currently scary thing happening sometimes feels like the prose equivalent of pounding music in a movie to remind us that a certain scene is supposed to inspire terror when the absence of such cues would probably make it more scary as they would make me feel I'm facing the terrifying thing on my own without the narrator to hold my hand and tell me what I should feel about it. Another slightly distracting feature of King's prose in ""The Shining"" is that while his writing is frequently beautiful you can tell that he had the thesaurus handy, and it even invades the dialog with Jack Torrance using the word ""dray"" when being playful with his wife and son. Even with a character who is supposed to be a writer this somehow strained credibility for me. And one of the strongest aspects of the novel for me in the middle weakened the conclusion in my opinion - the scariness of not knowing how much of Jack's transformation to evil murderous maniac is because of the hotel and how much is caused by his own inner demons seems completely obliterated by the way his behavior is handled towards the end of the book. King says in ""On Writing"" that the scariest villains are those with believable motivations that you can almost relate to and it's quite creepy the way Jack's inner rationalisations which eventually lead him to violence almost seem reasonable, and how the same character we might have seen as sympathetic at the start doesn't seem to have had to change all that much to become the bad guy. But by the end he's painted as a decent guy possessed by a demonic hotel and you almost get the sense that the ending was written before the earlier sections detailing Jack's thoughts as he loses his way. But while flawed this is still a horror novel you need to read, and also a painful mediation on how some of the very things that make a man needed by his family - focus on career, discipline, determination and single-mindedness - can backfire and tear a family apart.

  Wow. I decided to re-read this book in anticipation of Dr. Sleep and was pleasantly surprised. I first attempted to read this book when I was eight, at which point my mother discovered it and took it away from me in horror after nightmares kept me awake for a few nights. I went back to it in my teen years, and read it at least three more times. And then I put it away as childish.Don't get my wrong, I love Stephen King. And The Shining was a must for a child of Colorado, growing up not far from Estes Park. The Stanley Hotel is said to be The Overlook, although it is in Estes Park and not higher up, and it is reachable in the winter. But there came a time when I believed I had outgrown that kind of scary, forgetting how psychologically scary The Shining actually is.I re-read this just in time for the sequel, Dr. Sleep, about 35 years after The Shining. And it is just a creepy-scary, just as real. Just like many books, re-reading it creates a different feeling. Reading it as a child I identified with Danny, the young son with ""the shining."" This time I'm a mother and a wife and I read it identifying with Wendy AND Jack. Both are flawed but wanting to be better, but sometimes the demons find you.And, like most Americans, the movie has snuck into my thinking. I remember both Jack and Wendy differently because of the movie (which is good, but doesn't do them justice). In the movie, Jack lets the evil in easily, which doesn't happen in the book. And Wendy is a dishrag of a woman, which she definitely in not in King's rendition of her.Needless to say, this book still scared me. It made me jump on more than one occasion. And I can't wait for Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  The shining is a terrifying read. King isolates the characters in a horribly haunted setting where real interaction and imagined ones merge-- a place where evil beings stalk the living. Where murder is encouraged and leaving isn't an option. For those that have not read this book and are a fan of horror than this is a must read for you. I don't want to say to much to give away the story ---but the setting, the characters the phsycological terror all make it a perfect read for lovers of spooky books and haunted places.

  Somewhere in my memories, I created one that said ""The Shining? Of course I've read it!"" But I hadn't. And all these years later, I've just finished it and find myself stunned.I was browsing the reviews for Dr Sleep (which is seconds from being downloaded) and there were a few comments I simply didn't recall from this story (boiler? Halloran alive?), seeing it on sale, I dove into it first.This book is not Kubrick's movie. This book scared the hell out of me and my mom took me to see the Exorcist at 5 so I'm rather jaded. Halfway thru this book, I had to stop and watch the movie and I can't believe what I thought I knew about this book and what is really here.King doesn't create characters, he breathes life into them down to their DNA. There's something deeply touching of his treatment of Jack, it's more than fiction...it feels personal. Everyone always uses that phrase ""This is classic King"" when reviewing SK's work, but this is every facet of SK. The horror, the hope, the tragedy, the fall asleep with the lights on terror.Times have changed, our fear meters are more sophisticated. That doesn't hold true here. From the building tension, to the straight out scares of what might await you behind a door you shouldn't open or a sudden clattering of an elevator climbing to your floor that no one alive inhabits, this book will stay with you.If you think The Shining ended with a crazy dead guy in a frozen maze, you didn't read it either.
"
"
  This book is so underrated. The move is alright, but the book is so much better. Painful read at times, but couldn't put it down all the same. I love how the book takes Jack Torrance through his character development, making it disturbingly easy to relate to his character while being shocked and disgusted at the same time. Perfect ending, also. Easily one of King's best.
"
"
  I re-read this book after many years, and realized that I had forgotten much of it. It is so much better than the movie and once again, I realized that I didn't like the casting of the movie. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duval were not at all the way I had imagined the main characters, and when re-reading the book, this just reaffirmed that.  Going on to Doctor Sleep now.

  Madness, precognition, supernatural beings, and a creepy old hotel with a thousand stories all compete for center stage in the horror classic, ""The Shining"".  Written 40 years ago by horror master, Stephen King, there's not much that I can add to this review that hasn't been said many times before.King fans who revel in his distinctive style of writing that creates memorable characters and gut-wrenching plots, will find both in this great book.  The tension that is almost present from page one consistently builds throughout the novel to a wonderfully satisfying conclusion.And, while the book is supposed to be driven by the issues troubling the tortured Torrance family, it's actually the haunted Overlook Hotel and its secrets that are the most memorable images for this reviewer.  King did a wonderful job bringing the hotel to ""life"" by creating a number of back stories involving mobsters, lavish parties, and illicit affairs.As most King fans would agree, ""The Shining"" is one of his best and should be read by all horror fans.  After reading this, I feel confident in predicting that no one will ever experience a blizzard again without conjuring up images from this book.
"
"
  I have seen the movie a thousand times but never read the book. I have always loved Kings older books. So I decided to finally read The Shining.  This book kept me going the whole way through. But after reading it the movie really isn't that good to me any longer. So much larger out and changed. This book is great and will be rereading very soon. I highly recommend it
"
"
  Book arrived in perfect condition. This is one of those books you don't want to put down and also look up at the clock and realize you've been reading for 3 hours when it felt like 10 minutes. This is the first Stephen King book I've read and I will definitely read more of his books after I finish this one. All horror fans should give this book a read. On a side note. Do NOT watch the movie before you read it if you are able to.

  *Review first published on Goodreads*So much crazies! So this was my first Stephen King and I like it. However, I was expecting more scares. The kind that would make me throw my kindle across the room cos that's how freaked out I got. Having said that, while it wasn't pee-in-my-pants scary, this one gave me nightmares. I'm not kidding. The night before, I dreamed I got married to an abusive husband (like Jack Torrance although he's just an alcoholic and has anger management issues). Last night, I dreamed my house was about to blow up (just like the boiler). This one crept right into my subconscious mind; and that's worse.I need more money to buy more books!

  Wow. Where do I even begin? I now understand the world's obsession with Stephen King. Why did I wait until 2013 to start reading him? I'm not sure now. I've loved most of the movies as long as I can remember. I love horror stories. What's wrong with me? Haha.RECAP: Danny Torrance is a special boy. He's touched, has a gift, the ability to see things he shouldn't -- like into people's minds, into the future, things from the past.Jack Torrance is a struggling man. Mediocrity and failure have followed him since his abusive childhood, but he has a loving wife and a good boy. After making some mistakes, he gets a second chance -- a job to get them through for a while that will also provide free lodging and food. So he takes his family up to the Overlook Hotel in Colorado so he can be the caretaker over the winter months.They arrive on closing day, where they meet the cook, Dick Halloran, who instantly sparks with Danny. The special bond comes from what Dick calls ""the shining,"" the gifts that Danny has above and beyond the others Dick has met.As they settle in and prepare for winter, strange events start to unfold -- voices, lingering presences, moving topiaries, and the like.While the snow cuts them off from the rest of the world, the Overlook stirs to collect its prize...REVIEW: I have NEVER read a book with so much set up and build up information and storyline that didn't feel like filler or wordiness. I seriously felt that every detail King provided about this family's history was necessary to properly tell the story of what happens to the Torrances over their time at the Overlook.The characters in this story are all very well-developed -- Danny, Wendy, Jack, Dick, and most importantly, the Overlook Hotel and its denizens. Yes, it's fair to say that while Danny is the main protagonist, the hotel itself is just as much a main character as he is.This book masters the haunted house story, as well as the ""cut off from the rest of the world"" feeling, the buildup of impending dread, and the creation of a rich history surrounding the hotel and the family.King's novel does a much better job of showing this family as a normal family -- one that has its issues but still is happy and loves each other -- and how the hotel tears this family apart than the movies do. Kubrick's film unfortunately makes Jack's character appear insane before the real story begins, whereas the novel makes you go through his transformation and eventual loss of himself. Terrifyingly sad, really. It shows how the hotel can chip away at the man's weak points and destroy him.I seriously enjoyed this novel, and can't wait to read more of his classics. Now, I'm off to go rewatch both Kubrick's film and the TV miniseries of The Shining. This is definitely on my re-read list. :)

  I am quite possibly the only Stephen King fan alive who bypassed his most famous works-- It, Carrie, and, of course, The Shining. Thirteen years ago I picked up Hearts In Atlantis and have been an avid reader ever since.  I can't believe I've neglected The Shining for this long (I've never even seen the movie)!  One of the most fascinating and frightening things about King 's books is the way he sets his literary ""traps"", which uncoil unexpectedly in the midst of seemingly benign sentences, giving you a mere glimmer of the nasty little surprises in store for the reader . The Shining effortlessly creates that sense of breathless and nervous suspense at multiple places in the books. You brace yourself, and wait, and eventually recoil when the trap springs closed at your touch...and just when you think you've prepared for the worst you stick your hand right into the wasp's nest.  The complex psychological bond and bondage of the family dynamic is explored with terrific depth, the experience as raw and voyeuristic as if you were peering through the windows of your neighbors next door. Jealousy, dependency, and despondency war fantastically with the more tender feelings of love and hate. More importantly than seeing into their lives you feel such empathy for the family in this book as they fight the losing battle against insanity. You just know the dam is sure to break, and when the flood bursts through, all hell breaks loose!  Still, it's an incredible tale; albeit often tragic and dark, there's hope for the protaganists as individuals and as a family unit. You just cannot help but marvel at their strength and their love for one another in the midst of so much tragedy and horror.  Sparkling with beauty and insight, The Shining is a classic for a reason, a masterpiece of the American working-class family, as seen through the shadows within a very dark mirror, reminding us that the sins of the past always follow us home.  Phenomenal, spine-tingling writing; The Shining is King at his best!

  **This review is a comparison of the book and the movie (with Nicholson and Duvall). The reason is for ones like me that saw the movie and wasn't sure why they would need to read the book.** I love reading Stephen King though I admit I have a lot more books of his to read. I tend to pass over his books that were turned to movies since I initially know what they are about. Same with this book. My decision to read it was because he came out with Doctor Sleep which is a follow up to The Shining. I was told by a few who read the book and seen the movie that they are not quite the same. So I jumped into this one so I could read Doctor Sleep (all the time thinking it might be a waste of time though). I was wrong! Though I do love Stanley Kubrick's movie, I could also see why King was disappointed with it. There is so much more depth in the book (which there almost always is). But this was to a point you could almost understand the madness that Jack went through (unlike the movie where he pretty much seemed like a jerk  from the beginning). The book shows his love for his family and his family's love for him. His son idolizes him to the point it almost makes Wendy jealous. This is not something that is shown in the movie. I believe it is a big factor. It shows how strong these ""ghosts"" were to tear Jack down like that. There are also differences like Wendy's description is nothing like Shelley Duvall, the relationship between Danny and Dick Halloran is more intense in the book, and the ending was totally different. Even with all of that, I still love the movie but now I can say I love the book as well for the same and different reasons.

  First, I nearly always think the books surpasses the movie, but I almost always read the book first and notice what was lacking in the movie.  Or what was changed.  This time, I read the book much later than seeing the movie.  And the book filled in and added layers that made the story better.  Happy to pick this up and read it before seeing Doctor Sleep.

  I read The Shining back in the 80's when I was a teenager and found it mildly scary.  In preparation for the upcoming movie adaption of Doctor Sleep I decided to reread the shining and then read Doctor Sleep prior to the movie release.  I did not find the book to be scary but it was very suspenseful.  It sets a great atmosphere of seclusion and helplessness.  The characters were like-able yet flawed in their own ways.  While I enjoyed the movie I found I enjoyed the book more.

  This was my introduction to Stephen King. An old neighbor told me it was imperative I read it, so I bought a copy in 2016. It blew my mind. Since that first purchase in 2016 I became a die hard fan and I now own over 20 of his books. If you’re on the fence about whether or not to buy this book, I say go for it! It’s reasonably priced and a novel that is sure to make one hell of an impact!
"
"
  Finally I'm finished. It took me longer than I expected but I have this feeling of pride finishing this book. Now by no means does this mean I didn't like the book. This was a great book but not exactly what I expected.Most of King's work that I have read is new to me and I have no knowledge going in so I can form my own versions of the characters and events. This however, was made into a movie and a mini series, both I have seen years before I got around to reading this. Both were also pretty scary when I was a kid and I was really looking forward to being scared out of my mind reading this. Sadly this wasn't the case at all through this whole book. Other books by King such as It, and 'Salem's Lot sent me checking windows at night and made me scared to walk across my house in the middle of the night. The shinning didn't and even though I loved the story, since my expectations were so high, I am sticking to my four star rating. Had it lived up to my expectations and scared the pants off of me, this would have easily been a favorite.Ok, enough of the pet peeve. The reason I liked this book is because the story is so well written and the characters are so interesting. Some of King's lengthier books that have a lot of back story and character development such as The Tommyknockers, have left me bored to tears and wishing something would just happen already. Not the case with the Shining. The characters are so well done I wanted to know every little insignificant detail about them. There was a lot of build up before they even got to the Overlook hotel and were it might have been slow at times, I still found it interesting. Each character had me feeling for them in different situations. Knowing in advance what type of person Jack is, I still felt sorry for him and wished something would change and make the ending I already knew wrong. I wished I could pop into the story and rescue Danny and his mom during some of the more intense parts.I think I have gone on long enough. The short version is I really liked this book. If you are looking for a great story, with amazing characters this is defiantly for you. For those that are not as desensitized to the Macabre as I am, you might find this really scary and I hope you enjoy it. However, if you are like me and have read a lot of King's work and stuff just doesn't scare you as much as it used to, this is still very much worth the read.

  I finally picked this up after being a Stephen King for many years (the length was daunting to me initially). Wonderfully written, and almost nothing like the Kubric movie version. This is a classic ""the book is way better than the movie"" (as with most novel/movie iterations). Jack's slow demise is better explained, Wendy is a stronger, not annoying person and Danny is more mature given his gifts. On to Doctor Sleep!

  Just for fun, I read the bulk of this book while I was a guest at the Stanley Hotel in Colorado, which is the hotel that inspired Stephen King to write the novel. I'd sit in the lobby by the roaring fire, reading the book and then I'd wander into the ballroom or the bar where some of the best scenes in the story take place. It was sorta like an interactive reading experience and I would highly recommend it.And I would recommend the novel no matter where you read it. Its a classic haunted house tale with strange noises and ghosts and everything that goes with books in the genre. The main character is a guy named Jack Torrance, who is hired as the winter caretaker of a grand hotel that gets sealed off from the world by a Colorado snow storm. He's trapped in the hotel with his wife and young son, which is a really creative and scary situation. Throw in the fact that Jack is an alcoholic with a savage temper and the little boy has the shining, the ability to see events both past and future and the stage is set for a great read.The book contains several excellent passages on the consequences of excessive drinking and King has commented that some of the ""horrors"" the main character encounters in the hotel are symbols of some of the horrors of real life. The novel is full of action and suspense and, although a little overwritten in a few places, is a fun read whether you're spending time at the beach or in an isolated old hotel in the mountains of Colorado.

  There's something about classic Stephen King, a power or a raw intensity that grabs you and won't let go.  King shoots from the hip, his characters are likeable, and more importantly, believable.  In ""The Shining"" Mr. King weaves a story that will occupy far more of your thoughts than you might want.  I would place this work among the top five truly memorable horror stories of the twentieth century.
"
"
  This kept me hooked even though I already knew the ending right from the beginning. It was just the right amount of believable, corner-of-the-eye plausible deniability to be creepy for a long time and finally creepy turns to outright scary. I didn't think I was all that scared while reading until one of my kids yelled and I about jumped out of my chair!

  Let me just start by saying I enjoyed THE SHINING.  There's a reason it's considered a classic.  Jack, Wendy, Danny, Mr. Halloran, the Overlook and its ghosts, they're all brought to life with enviable imagination by a writer who is, without doubt, immensely talented.  To describe the plot -- Jack Torrance becoming caretaker of the Overlook Hotel for the winter; his young son Danny cursed with the ""shining"", the ghosts of the hotel recognizing this and eventually launching a full assault on the Torrance family as the story comes to a close -- feels a bit redundant because the book, for good reason, is famous and familiar.But it's not perfect.  Now, before the King apologists start sharpening their pens to leap to his defense, just give me a minute to explain.What you see in THE SHINING is a young writer at work.  A Stephen King who was not yet ""Stephen King"".  I believe this was his first full-length novel -- CARRIE being a short story --, so what you'll discover is someone finding his way, page by page, paragraph by paragraph.  You'll see a beginning that starts a bit slow.  You'll find some very dense paragraphs, a few repetitive sentences, the same words being used again and again.  You'll see a bit of stilted dialogue.  Perhaps even one or two moments that don't quite ring as true as the rest.Now, does this make this a bad book?  Of course not!  Just the opposite.  As I said, it really is a thrilling story imperfectly told, those imperfections, for lack of a better word, in the writing neither marring nor diminishing the enjoyment of the read.Honestly, for someone like me -- who's a writer at the beginning of his career -- reading THE SHINING was a wonderful gift.  To see Mr. King finding his voice and realizing that, with continued work, I, too, could move beyond my initial efforts and carve a similar career really drove me to sit down and write even more.Many believe Stephen King is one of the greats.  I'd agree.  And if you're interested in seeing a Great working out the kinks, finding his voice, and still telling a damn good story, THE SHINING is a great place to begin.

  I have read a handful of Stephen King, however had never picked up this one. After repeatedly reading reviews stating that ""The Shining"" is one of his best, I decided to give it a try.Since most people reading this review will have already read the movie, I will make some comparisons between the two and point out just why it is SO much better as a book than a movie.In the usual Stephen King style, the book is wonderfully descriptive; creating a world that you can believe and imagine in your mind without being overly drawn out or taking away from the plot.  But more importantly, the book provides so much more detail on the relationship between the family, and also provides details that simply could not be shown in a movie. We all know that Jack goes crazy and that his son can 'shine', but these are mental/emotional things that cannot be visually shown.  The book provides all of this detail and really makes the story much more interesting.I would strongly recommend that any fan of Stephen King, or the movie, should read this book.

  As an 80's child and lover of all things horror, I grew up thinking the movie was a Stephen King classic and would be revered for decades, like, in my opinion, pet semetary and cujo. Problem is, I simply didn't like it. It didnt make sense! Stephen King, however, I adore, so I decided to read the book and see how I could I be so dissatisfied when I never had been before. I'm glad I did! The movie, quite honestly, didn't even come CLOSE to the book! Danny never used a silly talking finger in place of Tony and his imaginary presence is in such detail that he actually makes SENSE. Danny's gift is fully explained, as well as Jack's demons, and Wendy is a character you can sympathize with instead of a quivering mess that's whining makes you want to jab sharp objects into your eardrums. My heart raced with panic as Danny approached the fire hose, the hedge animals, the forbidden guest suite. Even if you enjoyed the movie, which I obviously did not, I recommend you read this book! Its sure to draw you deeper into the horror of the Overlook Hotel, quite possibly enough to give you goose flesh the next time you stay at a hotel or step onto an elevator.

  This review is from my goodreads account. ( [...] )So when I saw The Shining by Stephen King on Amazon for $1.99, I couldn't stop myself from getting it. It was my first time reading a horror book and I thought to myself “How can a book be scary?” Well after 3 or 4 sleepless nights, I can tell you: They can scare the bejeesus out of you.If you never heard of The Shining, the book follows the Torrances, Jack, Wendy, and their five year old Danny, as they spend the winter in the Overlook hotel. As time goes on, the hotel shows the dark history that has happened there. Slowly Jack, who is a recovering alcoholic and who has his own history that is dark, becomes obsessed with the hotel that is driving him crazy.I've never read a Stephen King book before and loved how he writes the characters personalities, relationships, and chemistry.For instance, the chemistry between Danny and Dick Hallorann is simply amazing. They click together so well together because they both have the shining. You can really tell that Hallorann really cares for Danny and even faces his fears to help him.The relationship between Wendy and Jack are well written also. As you read you can feel the relationship shift with the story and how they both can't forget about the past, which causes it's own issues as it goes on.I love how the book slowly gets into the horror of the hotel. When the Torrances first arrive at the hotel you see glimpses of the horror, then as the book goes on the terror you feel as reading happens more often and is more terrifying than the last. Thankfully, how it's written it lets your heart adjusts to the pounding by easing into the terror where it won't give you a heart attack. If the book started with how intense the ending is in the beginning, I'm pretty sure I'd be dead at the age of 21 from scaring me to death.

  When I was young and dumb, I thought King's work was childish. I'm a grown-up now and appreciate reading through the work of this master. He knows how to pace and plant a line here and there that messes with your head, and the visual quality of his writing makes it easy to get lost in the world he creates. King keeps you guessing on many different levels, while somehow avoiding confusion. The terror builds slowly, and when it hits, it hits hard. I slept with the lights on.This is one of the few books at this price point that doesn't tick me off. For writing this good in a big, juicy book that lets me wander through the world created, I'll go the extra money for the ride.I'd recommend this book for anybody who enjoys storytelling that's through the roof, likes being taken places they'd rather not go, and those with the focus to wander through a big book and enjoys getting lost in the grip of a master.

  Anything fro Stephan King will have you on your toes, this book was better then the movie, Jack was different then the movie was, the hotel had his mind taken over by something while the movie version had Jack going mad,, Books always tell a better Story then TV versions, this was my Favorite Book by Stephan King I wanted this book for a long time but could not find it,, Thanks to amazon I found it and loved reading every minute of it..

  I first saw the movie of The Shining when I was eight years old and, since, then, have had a distrust of long corridors that I can't seem to outgrow. I'd never planned to read the book until I read how little King liked the book. Of the reasons he mentioned, one stuck out in my mind: how weak the wife was in the movie, and how he thought it sexist. I decided to pick up the book.All I can say to those who enjoy the movie and want a ""light"" book to read (I say light for writing style, certainly not for content): pick it up. The characters have significantly more depth in the book; the story is creepier, make much more sense, and imbues Danny and Wendy with much more power and awareness. While there are a few over-the-top flourishes that are certainly both quintessentially King and slightly superfluous, the majority of the novel is a tight ride into the final falling apart of a family.

  I read this book years ago when it first came out and have the paperback somewhere.  The first read was a scary, Stephen King story and as in all his books the characters become real and you travel with their adventure.  I can't say what I would have rated it on the first read as my impression was so long ago.But I downloaded the ebook into my Kindle tor bring me up to speed in advance of his then pre-ordered Dr. Sleep, which is a follow up to the original.Refreshing my mind of the story was essential to reading Stephen Kings upcoming book.  Therefore I read with that mindset and reattached my self in maybe a more intense way to really grasp The Shining.  I am so glad I did.  I enjoyed the 2nd read I think more then the first as it is now memorable, the characters have become alive and I could not wait for the now released Dr.Sleep which I am presently reading.  I highly recommend if you haven't read it, if you have read before like I did, read AGAIN, you need the characters to be fresh before you start the next step which is the newly released Dr. Sleep.  Thank you Stephen King for your ability not only to create believable characters but paint them so colorfully that they become real.

  If you have only seen the Kubrick film, you owe it to yourself to read the book.  I am a constant reader and fan of Stephen King and I enjoyed the movie many years ago, but until Doctor Sleep was released I never read The Shining.  I thought I knew all about the Overlook hotel and Danny Torrence, but even knowing the film, the book was so much more nuanced and delightfully scary that I was upset with myself for not reading it sooner.  Statuary has always been exceedingly creepy to me so the hedge animals that torment Danny are enough to push this book into the ""things I've read that haunt my dreams"" category, and thank you Mr. King for my new found fear of fire hoses. I love when a character makes you torn in your loyalties and you can't decide if you are for them or against them.  Many of the characters dance on that line, but none more so than Danny's father.  As you watch him battle his addictions and the dark things that prey on him you wonder if you were in his shoes how you would fare.  Best of all, when you're finished with The Shining you can read Doctor Sleep and find out more about the dark spirits that haunt this family and book.

  I just read The Shining for the first time in thirty years in preparation for Dr. Sleep. The first time I read it, I was twelve, and no - I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR TWELVE YEAR OLDS. You know your kids - you can figure out what they should be reading. But I digress.I found a few things really interesting about the experience of rereading, each involving either the success or failure of my memory. First, I was amazed at whole passages that were emblazoned on my twelve year old brain and consequently recognized by my forty-two year old brain. Second, I've read a bunch of Stephen King since then, and my opinion is that he gets better as the years roll by. So when I revisit one of his early books, I'm surprised at how accomplished he was even in those first few offerings. My biggest complaint about Stephen King is that his great strengths - his imagination and describing the inner lives of his characters - are often undermined when it is time for the story to be driven by events rather than characters. The Shining is no exception. So I marveled at his literary descriptions of Jack's regrets and struggles because in my selective memory, The Shining was just a book about a haunted hotel and a crazy person. Which brings me to the third thing. Like many people, I've seen the iconic Stanley Kubrick film version of The Shining a few times, all since my first reading of the novel. The film tainted my memory of major plot points, including who lives and who dies. So it was very interesting to contrast what happens in the novel that doesn't in the film and vice versa. Kubrick succeeded in making a great horror film, but as an adaptation, it's a failure. It was nice to return to the source and set the record straight in my own memory.One final note - I enjoyed Dr. Sleep immensely and unless you have read The Shining in the last few years, I would recommend rereading it before moving on to the sequel.
"
"
  I'd seen the movie years and years ago, the Jack Nicholson version.  As a kid, I had every Stephen King book but this one.  Just finished the read.  Previously I read Doctor Sleep, so after finishing The Shining, I opened up Doctor Sleep again and reread it.  It was almost like a single flow book.If you've not read it, this is a slight spoiler alert.The Shining is crazy good.  The fright factor from the book is enormous compared to the movie which by itself was scary enough, but back then it simply appeared to me that Jack was going insane.  Not until I read the book did I realize otherwise.  Strongly recommend this for your King collection if you don't have it already.It would be awesome (side note) if amazon would offer an audio app for its books via my amazon account on Roku.  Listening through the giant booming speakers from my TV while I'm cleaning the house or cooking would be a fantastic way for me to continue ""reading"" while attending to other things that require activity and NOT be tethered to earbuds.

  I do not read horror, because I don't like it. But I read Stephen King's THE SHINING, because I'd read his book ON WRITING and I wanted to see what he was like as a writer.I can't say that I enjoyed reading it, because explicit scenes of death and destruction just don't appeal to me. But I could see what a good writer King is. I was surprised to see how much his technique of suspense rests of foreshadowing. Much of this comes from the point of view of Danny, the 5-year-old son of Jack Torrance, who signs on to be the housekeeper of the Overlook Hotel one winter. Of course, Danny can't understand what his gift ""the shining"" shows him. So the foreshadowing is necessarily blurry and vague. But that is what drives the novel, of this scared young boy seeing things he can't understand. Throw into the mix a recovering alcoholic with a dangerous temper, and you have great material for conflict. But King doesn't stop there. His imagination soars as we gradually realize that the hotel is a personage as well.If you are a horror aficionado, and you've never read this, you owe it to yourself to do so. Five stars.

  This earlier work of Stephen King still remains fresh and keeps you caught in its grip, eager to flip to the next page and continue on to the very end despite how many years have passed since it's first conception. It has not staled in time or become dated as some stories do. As one of his earlier works, it's not the masterpiece that the Stand is by far, but its characters are endearing and lend for you to sympathize and see a little bit of your self in the good, bad an ugly encounters that occur to them.Stanley Kuprick and the cast did a great job with the film and no one can argue that Jack's Jack is engrossingly believable in the film but over all the tale seems so much more in depth and wrought with despair by reading it. As a fan of horror and also of Stephen King, this book still manages to make the hair on the back of my neck raise more than once despite reading it a second time after many years and having just recently re-watched the film.When they say it's a page turner of a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is exactly what they mean and why King is praised for what he does. So sit back and let the Overlook Hotel invite you in.

  I originally read this about 25-30 years ago as a youngish boy.It's still great.I'm sure the gajillion reviews available out there already cover the hot review-points, so I'll make quick of this:Simply put, it's a good idea and story.  And, it's written well.One of my favorite quotes from the book:""Mommy's face was pale, and there were horrible brownish bruises on her neck where Daddy had tried to...where Daddy had tried to hug her too tight.""That's just one of many morsels from the book which is simultaneously frightening and darkly humorous (sort of).The thing that bothers me is that anyone could possibly give this book a 1-star rating.  There are, in my opinion, very, very, very few books deserving of a true 1-star rating.  Are you saying that the book was mechanically unsound & poorly written; had a horrible plot; was badly constructed; had undeveloped characters; and no redeeming qualities whatsoever?  Does this book really strike you that way?Or was it just that you didn't like it?  Was it just a topic you did not fancy?  Was the ending not what you wanted to see?  Was something left to your imagination and you prefer to have things clearly resolved for you?But, again, that's just my opinion and why it is rare that I will give a book a 1-star rating.  I will even bump it up a notch if I see that other people have found joy in the book when I did not...because the writer obviously knew how to please an audience...just not me.But, I digress - how silly of me.  I suppose that was the defensive, paternal instinct coming out.It's a great book, give it a try!

  I first read ""The Shining"" in 1977 and I don't know how many times I have read it since then. I consider it to be one of Stephen King's best books and just reread it again because I heard King is finally publishing a sequel to Danny's story called 
"
"Doctor Sleep"
"
   due out in September 2013. I can hardly wait.This tale of the Torrance family, especially Danny with ""the shine,"" the Overlook Hotel, and Halloran, the cook, is a masterpiece of horror. I consider ""The Shining"" and 
"
"It"
"
   two of the scariest books I've ever read. I think this is because not only because of the supernatural horror aspects of both books but also the human elements that contribute to the horror.I also love both versions of the movie made about this book - the well-known movie with Jack Nicholson, scary but not following the book very well - 
"
"The Shining"
"
  , and the mini-series that was faithful to the book - 
"
"Stephen King's The Shining  (Two Disc Special Edition)"
"
  .If you have never read this book and love horror, you owe it to yourself to read it. If you've read it before, read it again to reacquaint yourself with the great story and characters before the sequel comes out.

  I hadn’t read this since it first came out in paperback so late 70s. I loved it then. Couldn’t put it down. This time I had a hard time getting going. But once I really started reading it roared on, like a train on fire. It’s perfect. Scary(of course), nuanced, and a complete novel. It starts out somewhat happily, with very flawed people and then they meet the truly evil  and  takes off from there. And as this happens, the flaws come to light. One triumphs, one succumbs, except at the very end.. love this book!

  I’ve read about half a dozen SK novels (The Stand, It, Salem’s Lot, etc.- mostly earlier works), and decided to give this one a shot. Well, as I had a free but dreary fall day to contend with, I ended up reading it front to back in a day. I loved it. I haven’t seen the Kubrick film yet so I’ll be watching to compare in a day or so- from famous clips and lines I’ve seen and heard over the years I realized about 2/3 through the book they must be quite different.My biggest takeaway: few, incredibly developed characters. I was turning pages so quickly because I was so invested in what was happening. Definitely my second favorite SK novel so far after It.

  Stunning exploration into the dynamics of family disintegration and a damn fine ghost story. Is the hotel the enemy? Is Jack? One can only decide for themselves ultimately. Vastly different than the equally brilliant Kubrick film, this novel is terrifying in its believably. Jack is clearly the worst candidate for the job, yet circumstances push him inexorably toward the mental breakdown at the Overlook. A must read for any horror fan. This is a high quality edition, with thick stiff paper, hard covers and a lovely dust jacket. We added it to our collection in our library as a book to keep forever.

  I needed a break from all the personal development books I've been reading.I've always liked the movie by Stanley Kubrick and was quite taken back by how different it is from the book. I mean REALLY different. I'm not a big fan of Directors who do that, but I must admit I like the movie, too. The movie makes me feel dirty when I watch it, and I like that. Ha!I really liked how slowly, and methodically, Stephen King progressed Jack into complete insanity. I didn't ever feel like he just snapped, but that whatever he was doing was just a little bit more insane than what he had previously done. Made it more realistic.I must admit, though, that I did feel sad at the end. Poor Danny. Being that young and watching his Dad, whom he loved, go completely insane. Ya, I'd be messed up, too. Ever since I became a father, things with children in them get to me more. I guess that's kudos to King for being such a great author.It was a great read for me. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a solid story with good characters.

  I was so amazed at this book compared to the movie.  Now I'm disappointed in the movie for not following the book.  I could hardly stop reading since I only thought I knew what happens next.  Not sure why the movie didn't follow the book more closely because it would have been so much better.  Shelley Duvall couldn't have played Mrs. Torrence from the book and even been right for it.  Let's face it, half way through the movie, I wanted to bash her head in.  Her whining version of the character made me sick to death.  So weak and so lame.  How did they even choose her for that part?  At least the book character had some backbone.  Just so enthralled with the book versus the movie that it was like reading something entirely different and so very much better.  If you've seen the movie and liked it, then give yourself a real present and read the book.  It's like opening a package when you were so sure what the contents were and then got a shock at the contents.

  The Shining is my first King novel that I've read all the way through (the other one was The Stand, but it scared me so bad, I stopped reading it). I've also never seen the movie based on The Shining, so there was nothing that could spoil this King classic for me.The Shining starts off pretty slow and is about a man named Jack Torrance who is hired as a caretaker for the Overlook Hotel during its off season. Strange happenings occur that play heavily on Jack and his son, Danny, who is very sensitive to the hotel's ghostly inhabitants.The pacing is very slow for the first hundred pages or so. In fact, the pace doesn't pick up until three hundred pages later once the hotel comes alive. I found that the subtle hauntings scattered throughout the book were the most frightening, because it's unclear whether the hauntings were imagined or not.I really enjoyed how the hotel itself became a character in the book. Was it really just a haunted hotel, or did it have its own twisted form of awareness? I'm curious to know what would it have done if did take Danny's powers?Overall, I enjoyed the book. Once you get past the slow pacing, it's an engaging read with memorable characters and spine chilling moments.

  I enjoyed the movie version of this book, and I'll admit I couldn't help but picture Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance. The movie never really frightened me, though, whereas I can say for a fact that there were more than a few times after reading in bed at night that as I closed my eyes to go to sleep I kept hearing, ""The Red Death held sway over all! Unmask! Unmask!"" I really enjoyed how much more of Danny's point of view is expressed in the novel, whereas I felt that the movie centered on Jack with Danny as more of an afterthought.*Spoiler to anyone who hasn't read the book or watched the movie* It was definitely much more impacting to read about Jack trying to murder Wendy at the end of the novel versus watching it. The entirety of this scene seems to happen very quickly in the movie, and there is just something very different about seeing someone get hit with a mallet and actually reading about how the ribs break and the back is broken and how agonizing it is just to try and get away from this horrible thing trying to kill you.*End of spoiler* King paints such a vivid picture of pain and terror, that I actually felt my own heart rate climb and my eyes get wider and wider with each sentence. Amazing. Simply put, pure perfection and I highly recommend to anyone looking for a pretty unsettling and fascinating read.

  Great story! I loved The Shining. This is the first Stephen King book I read. I have seen a few of his movies including The Shining. I enjoyed the writing, a great and powerful read in the horror category. I'm looking forward to watching the movie again since I read the book and I can't wait to read the sequel Doctor Sleep and find out how Danny Torrance is doing.I give The Shining 5 stars for its thrilling story.I would recommend this book to horror fans.
"

  Four and a half stars.  Not quite five, but a ""very well done"" nevertheless.  There are some differences between movie and book of course in distinct ways.  The book is over 450 pages and so there is some stuff left out in the movie version but the basic story lines are followed quite closely.  As I recall, there was nowhere near the detail of Jack's life pre Overlook that the book covers, particularly his drinking forays with rich guy Al.  The most significant differences seem to be in the ending.  Jack's demise is very different in the book, a lot more fitting.  And the fortunes of Dick Halloran are also markedly different (thank goodness).  I suppose what attracted me to the book at this stage was the recent release of Doctor Sleep.  I enjoyed ""The Shining"" book very much but won't likely read the follow-up.  I think I've had enough.  (And for those dying to know....there is no ""Here's Johnny"" in the book - why do I think that's strictly a Jack Nicholson creation???).  One great attraction of the movie - that I had forgotten - was the great scenery in the opening credits; not Colorado by the way.
"
"
  I love this book. This was the second time I read through it. The characters are well developed and you have empathy for them. I love that between sentences, King sometimes puts what the character is thinking while the dialogue is happening, so you get this inner monologue that shows the emotions and thoughts. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

  I am going to write this review under the assumption that most of us have seen the film.  If you haven't seen the film, you may not want to read on, as there may be some spoilers.  On the other hand, I have seen the film 100 times and still enjoyed this novel heartily.  Both novel and film are radically different from each other.It has been years since I saw ""The Shining"" for the first time.  Ever since then, I had kept hearing about how different the book was, how disappointed King was with the change to the story.  I had always, at some point, wanted to read the novel to see how Kubrick changed it.  As an aspiring filmmaker myself, I am always interested to read novels that have been made into films to see how they adapted it into a screenplay.  As mentioned before, King's novel is quite different than Kubrick's film.  Which do I like better?  King's novel by a long shot.  Though I am a huge fan of cinema and love Kubrick's work... a lot was lost through his interpretation/translation of the film.For example, Kubrick depicts Jack as a menacing maniac who is out to slaughter everyone from the get-go, estranged from his mother and son who seem to look out for each other under Jack's terror.  In the novel it is quite the opposite.  Father and Son are the family members that are close, with Wendy the odd one out... actually jealous of Danny's relationship with his father.  Family interactions are lost in the film.  The novel makes much more sense as to what is going on.  There is more of a point to show that the HOUSE itself is haunted, and begins to control Jack... and his hallucinations are in fact hallucinations.  Not ""real entities"" as the film may suggest.The sequence of events differs slighty, as well as key moments in the story.  Halloran, the radio, room 217, Jack's downfall, etc.  The dialouge is more intriguing, the urgency to esacpe, the terror itself... much more hair-raising.  Even the ending is completely different.  But I definitely love this book, it rates up there with ""Misery"" of the King books I have read.  Buy it used, I got mine (first edition hardcover) right here off marketplace sellers for dirt cheap.And sorry folks... no hedge maze.
"
"
  I really enjoyed reading the book. I've seen the movie several times but somehow missed reading the book, and I'm a SK fan. The book is slightly different than the movie, and I appreciated getting the the more in depth story, especially of Danny. I wanted to read Dr. Sleep, which is about Danny, so it was important to me to read The Shining and get to know Danny a little better. If you haven't read the book you're missing out, even though the movie was great.
"

  I haven't read ""The Shining"" in many years.  I wanted to revisit it, especially with the sequel coming out this fall.  This is Stephen King in top form.  It's a great read.  He builds the tension slowly and it's a fun ride.  There's nothing scary but it will give you the creeps, as well as a few tears and some laughs.  It's a little bit of everything.  Forget what you saw in the movie.  Kubrick made his version of the story, take the time to read the story as it was originally meant to be.  What's great about this book is that unlike the film you get to know the characters more and find out what makes them tick.  In addition, you get to see what each person is thinking and it makes more sense as to why each character does what he or she does.  Yes, Jack Nicholson was great at going insane.  But getting into Jack Torrance's head and seeing how and why he slides into madness is much more interesting.  Again, not scary but just creepy and a great read.  A few dated parts, but otherwise a fun ride.  Enjoy it.

  The Shining was the film adaptation that led King to vow never to give over creative control of one of his stories ever again.  That's truly unfortunate, as King's movies and mini-series have mostly been embarrassing flops.Kubrick, on the other hand, and true to his reputation, made a fine movie with ""The Shining.""  I love it, and for too long I figured I didn't need to bother with the book.  but now having read it I realize what a mistake that was.  Kubrick's film is a classic, indeed, but it is not at all the same story that King tells in these pages.  Not only is the story substantially different (and scarier, and for completely different reasons), it really is better.  I get why King was so embittered.This book possesses the psychological terror that was the focus of the film, but without the ambiguity surrounding the origin of the murderous force that grips Jack Torrance.  In addition there are moments of supernatural violence that are a staple of King's work, but wholly absent from Kubrick's film.  Several scenes in this book were scary enough, and so vividly described, that they will stick with me well into the future.  I've read a great deal of King 's work, this very well may be the best.I'm so glad I didn't just watch the movie again.
"
"
  It was kind of boring since it was really long. I would not recommend this book. I don't hate Stephen King's work though.
"
"
  I'm obviously a big fan of the movie but I actually chose to read this because a friend of mine recommended it. He told me it was the scariest book he ever read, and he was right! It was pretty intense but in a don't want to put it down kinda way. If you've never read a novel of his before, then you won't be expecting this weird, eclectic, particular style of writing. It's something to get used to but overall very interesting. The movie and book are very different so don't expect it to be line for line or anything like that. I am happy to say though that the book is much better than the film. Great read with a great satisfying ending.
"
"
  It's not fair, but it's inevitable if you've seen the movie that you're going to compare the two versions.  As much as I love the movie, I really liked the elements of the book that Kubrick chose not to use.  I thought the background info on Jack was really great and *loved* that Wendy was made of a little stronger stuff than what we saw in the movie.  And I liked Hallorran's story more in the book as well.One thing I really enjoyed is how King took the old evil house story and elevated it.  The way he told the story was very successful at mixing in the character's thoughts and those coming from the Overlook into the main text.  I wasn't crazy about some of the stuff he did with Danny's thoughts (the spelling stuff seemed a little hokey), but overall it was a smart way to add to the story.Like it always seems with this genre, there was a flaw--the evil is almost always made out to be so powerful and pervasive, yet it is often defeated by rather mundane or convenient circumstances.  It wasn't an unscathed victory though, so I give King credit for that.
"
"
  I saw the Kubrick movie when I was a kid. Scared the pants off me. The movie is nothing compared to the book. The deep character development is so good. I wish I had read this book as a young adult then now in my 40’s. It would have probably read differently and I would have enjoyed it on two different levels.
"
"
  I read this book way back when it came out, when two out of three people in any given airport, at any given time, were reading a novel by Stephen King.  I remember seeing the movie with a sense that it wasn't true to the book and that the book was better than the movie.  I watched the movie recently and I have to confess that Jack Nicholson's performance is outstanding and has set a new bar for psychotic terror.  I decided to give the book another try after all these years to see if it still holds up to my memory.  It does.  In fact the book is a very different kind of story than the movie although many of the scenes from the movie are lifted from the book with little alteration.  The characters are deeper in the book.  There is more of a back story to Jack and Wendy's psychological quirks.  There is more of a sense that the evil force in the Overlook Hotel is toying with Jack's personal weaknesses and demons and using those to turn him against his family.  Also there is more drama, as Jack fights an ultimately heroic but tragic battle to save himself and his family.  In a way the book has a more satisfying ending which is very different from the ending of the movie.  I found the book to be a great example of classic haunted house fiction, like the Haunting of Hill House and the Turn of the Screw, to name two other outstanding examples.  The book is scary and it became almost impossible to put down.  Nice performance by Jack Nicholson.  Nice casting by Kubrick.  I'll take the book over the movie.  And then there was the bonus of finding out that there is, or soon will be, a sequel by Stephen King!
"
"
  If one is into terror, horror or suspense, I doubt they have not read this book.  I hope they have read the book and do not think either  the movie or the mini series did it justice.  This is the first Stephen King book I ever read and I have it in hardback, but I wanted the Kindle version as I am now 80 years old and reading on the Kindle is much easier. I love my Kindle as both the print size and the spacing can be adjusted.  Most of the readers I know, if asked which Stephen King book is their favorite, will say either The Shining or The Stand. I agree with both of those selections but must also include IT as I really liked that one also. I believe The Shining is a MUST read.  If you have not read it yet, you MUST.  Stephen King has a way with words that make a scene come alive in your mind and you can see it all so clearly.  Truly a great book.
"
"
  Of course you can't put everything from a book into a movie, but this is absolutely better than what came out on the silver screen. Even a perfect representation of Jack by Jack could not pull it off. Awesome in its mystery and wonderful in its outcome. I will read another King masterpiece after this one!
"
"
  This is the second time I've read this book, getting ready to read Doctor Sleep.  The book was as I had remembered, reading it all those years ago, all as I had remembered except the last chapter. Of course the ending of the movie was different as they usually take too many liberties and change it up, but that's Hollywood. In any case I was a little confused by the last chapter, the narrative calling himself Dan and not Jack? So did that mean he was all grown up now and just doing odd jobs here and there to keep himself supplied with booze, thereby turning basically into his alcoholic father? Anyway I didn't understand the end, who was doing the narrating, Jack or Danny, and who is Dennis? Nonetheless, it was and still is one of my favourites. He is a truly brilliant writer, which is great since he has written so many exceptionally riveting books.I will always b a fan, he is my number 1 author.
"
"
  Stephen King very rarely disappoints, and even though this was a re-read (after MANY years)...it was just as good!! Once you're drawn in, fuggetaboitit!! There's no turning back until the very end. Wonderdul, terrifying, deliciously entertaining read. Again!
"
"
  I'm pretty sure this book was written when I was a baby or before my time but just an amazing thriller. It is a psychological thriller at its finest. I have yet to see the movie, but I'm definitely going to check it out now.The Shining is a great book because you have a protagonist and antagonist all in one or more of the characters (I won't spoil it but you'll learn who and why) which is tough to conceptualize. You have the internal conversations of each main character, the symbolism of the Overlook Hotel and its dark history, the physical alienation from the rest of the world during a specific season every year. You take the general conflicts that many families deal with, add seclusion, a never ending series of psychologically transcending moments, and you have one intense story. It bubbles up slowly and you feel very uncomfortable reading it at times because you know something bad is going to happen and when it does, its worse than you can imagine.

  I needed to read a scary book for my 2015 Reading Challenge and after asking several friends, settled on The Shining. I've never seen the movie and I am not a big King fan mostly because I'm not into horror stories. Also, because I think he gets a little winded in his writing, so to speak. Anyway, I thought this was a great story and it did freak me out quite a few times. It wasn't as scary as the movie snippets make it out to be though. Mostly creepy just because of the idea of all the evilness building up into a thinking, acting entity. I may be reconsidering my previous disposition to SK. A good read!
"
"
  Classic horror. I've seen Stanley Kubrick's The Shining numerous times throughout my life but never gave the book my attention. Enjoyable cover-to-cover read. I highly prefer the ending to the novel rather than the Kubrick film. Kubrick's film was purposefully changed as such to meet his vision of the story. That I do understand and do not criticize based on this. But I'm here to rate the novel, not the Kubrick film. And I rate it 5 stars unashamedly. Just now getting into reading Stephen King rather than just watching movies based off his works. Maybe I'll tackle The Stand next :)
"
"
  I recently reread this book. I first read it years ago being one of the first Stephen king books I read. I thought it was great then and I still think it’s a great book now. It’s a slow burn where the story takes about half the book setting up the scene and characters. This just gets you read for the good stuff that is eerie, creepy, and anxiety filled fun. Definitely better than the movie, just saying! Watch out for the playground!
"
"
  Clearly one of his more famous works for a reason, this is a great book, and much, much better than the movie.King writes many different forms of evil, but the Shining is his first that delves into a form of evil that exists beyond the realm of simple human malevolence. It's a menacing, ancient sort of evil that has no cause or cure, it just exists, waiting for unfortunate people to wander in. You can find the same style of evil in It, Dream Catcher, the Stand, and the Dark Tower series.If you like King already and haven't yet read the Shining, get to it! If you are looking for a good book to pop your King cherry with, this is a great choice.
"
"
  Re-read this book in anticipation of 'Dr. Sleep' and holy poop on a stick is this book scary.I had read it years ago and during the intervening years watched the Kubrick film countless times. Since I had forgotten much of the book, I couldn't understand why Stephen King was rumored to be so displeased with the Kubrick film.Well after completing the re-read, I completely understand! The film, while brilliant, is nothing like the book.'The Shining' explores addiction, child abuse, wounds we harbor from our own parents aaannnd ghosts! (But aren't all those old mistakes and scars from childhood ghosts?)Fantastic. Don't short yourself by only watching the film and if you haven't watched the film... READ THIS FIRST!!...and I'm super-psyched about 'Dr. Sleep'

  After seeing Stanley Kubrick's The Shining for the first time recently, I got interested in reading its source material. Just like the movie, I quickly discovered that King's book is an incredibly creepy, well-constructed psychological thriller. I love that his prose is vividly descriptive without being pretentious, something I've appreciated about the other books of his that I've read. Plus King just has a knack for telling supernatural/paranormal stories. The main way that his original tale differs from Kubrick's film adaptation, is that it allows you to really get inside the head of each character, especially Jack Torrance. Jack becomes a much more complex, sympathetic person as you get to know him and understand his internal monologue. In a way you come to feel bad for him, because you realize what a tragic, self-destructive individual he is. Torrance can't help placing himself in rotten situations and he's terrible at resisting temptation, which is why the spirits of the Overlook Hotel have a field day with him. King's prose, his ability to write about the paranormal, and his great characters were really what propelled the narrative for me to make The Shining so much fun.
"
"
  This was the first Stephen King book I read years and years ago.  It's still my favorite,  and I've read it several times.  Still enjoy it.  It can be scary for some. I don't find it frightening, oh maybe a little when Danny trikes upstairs and visits some of the empty but inhabited rooms.  But, it's not on the level of the books and movies that devote your time to sadistic junk where people have to chop off pieces of themselves.  How gross.  This is far more subtle and is a great movie...not for the little ones though, but you know what your kids can take and enjoy.  This has ghosts and the father goes nuts and mother and son must escape.  Look for the really scary topiary figures.  Just know which children will love it and which ones will be ruined for life.  My boys loved it.
"
"
  I picked this up because I've just started getting into King over the last couple years. I always liked the movie, but mainly I didn't want to read the sequel (Doctor Sleep) until I actually read the original. I was blown away! Of all his books I've read of his I keep finding his older work to be a bit more engaging. This is no exception. And I ended up being a tad disappointed in Doctor Sleep after reading this first. This definitely had some really creepy moments. So far I'd rate this my third favorite novel. Right below The Long Walk (with The Stand being number one), and right above It.
"

  1. This is NOT a first edition as advertised.2.  It is NOT signed by Stephen King as shown.3.  Came without jacket.4.  In poor condition, with a broken binding and crushed corners with exposed cardboard.  Also has what looks like a food stain on pages.

  I've been a fan of the Kubrick film for years, but I've always been told it was a completely different experience from the book. I'm not a hardcore Stephen King fan, but I have really enjoyed quite a few of his works. I absolutely love the entire Dark Tower series, and I also have enjoyed a few others such as Talisman, It, and 11/2/63. Now, as a result of finally reading The Shining then its sequel, I'm likely to dive into a bit of a Stephen King binge.The Shining is an incredible novel, and I like it all the more since it was written in the 1970s. It is truly a completely different story from that told in Kubrick's film, but I don't want to issue any spoilers so I'm not going to talk about how. But I was riveted all the way through, and I would highly recommend this for anyone who reads King.

  As a fist time reader of Stephen King, I chose the spooky The Shining. I was under the impression it would be similar to the movie and didn’t expect to be surprised. However, I was very mistaken. This novel was a slow builder, it brought you into the lives and mind of four people.  The creepy way the story leads you to suspense is just brilliant.
"
"
  My first King read and I loved it.Perhaps I am biased because I love all things Kubrick and loved the film so much, but I found no flaws in this book. It had the perfect pace, setting, and characters.If all his books are like this one, I need to read them all!Favorite passage:""outside he could hear the storm whooping and screaming, seeming to choke on its own dark throat filled with snow.""
"
"
  I saw the movie before I read the book and I enjoyed both. Steven King didn't take 100 pages to describe a leaf, like it sometimes feels he does, which I appreciated. The biggest difference I would say between the book and the movie is the perspective from which the story is told. More of the dad's point of view in the movie and more of the son's in the book. Great read! Couldn't put it down!
"
"
  Of all the Stephen King books that eventually got the attention of the big screen, this story is one that DEFINITELY deserves your attention--the mantra is true here: ""book is better than the movie!"".  I grew up seeing the movie come on TV--thinking: hmmmm, Jack Nicholson, what a creep. This could be a neat written story...The character development of Jack in the book is even deeper--even creepier--even makes you care for and empathize with the guy!  The book, in my opinion, packs many VERY scary punches, far more than the movie.I am comparing it over and over to the movie... but I do this because lots of folks considered it an under-whelming film.  If you're in this crowd--I will still say that ""The Shining"" the BOOK is the antidote for you! Stephen King rocks--and this is one of his top 5 in stories. Do check it out!
"
"
  I absolutely LOVE this book!!I have read Salem's Lot and Pet Semetary by Stephen King and I loved them both!Salem's Lot being my favorite over Pet Semetary...So I wasn't sure how The Shining would compare to the way I loved the other 2! And I must say, I wasn't disappointed!! It's now my favorite out of the 3!I watched the movie several years ago when I was a child.I don't think the movie does it any justice, whatsoever!!Yes, I enjoyed the movie but the book tells a much different story in my opinion. I love that you really get to know the characters and what they are thinking and feeling. Instead of watching the story, you get to imagine what the hotel and ""monsters"" look like!I got so wrapped up in the story and characters. I will definitely read this one again!If you are unsure about whether you should read it or not, go ahead and read it! I promise you won't be disappointed!!
"
"
  Somehow, though I love the movie, I’d never read this book. I’ve read several other Stephen Kind novels and just never picked this one up. I’m glad that I did as I thoroughly enjoyed it. The later part of the book is significantly different than the movie so it wasn’t too much of a spoiler to know the movie well.
"
"
  Our entire family loves just about every books of his we've ever read. My son actually saved his money to purchase this book. It has definitely been a great read. The book itself is very easy to handle. Love how the book is physically put together. The text is the perfect size as well. Enjoyed this book very much!
"
"
  I hate a “wAtCh ThE mOvIe InStEaD” person. I hated the movie until I read this book. It explains everything in detail and I needed this to actually enjoy Kubrick’s work. I’ll recommend if you need depth for a story to make connections. King is still a horrible writer, don’t get me wrong, but I seem to enjoy his stories primarily for the visualization he brings to the pages.
"
"
  This is the second classic Stephen king novel I have read and what strikes me most is that though I know they are classified as horror, I don't think of them as such.  They feel more like psychology studies.  I am undecided about reading the story that continues about Danny, but would definitely recommend reading the literary versions of the shining and the stand even if you've seen the movies.
"
"
  Stephen King is the Master at this stuff, but there's something about the dynamic of these characters that just draws you in. I read this book when it first came out, and I was even more scared this time. FABULOUS BOOK! And now I'm on to the sequel!!!!
"
"
  I am fond of the movie, but almost always prefer books to the film adaptions, so I made time to sit down and read through the book -- and it was time well spent.  King gives his characters far more depth (as expected), and I found myself empathizing with characters I didn't care for in the movie.  Their interactions and your access to their thoughts add richness to the storytelling.  And because the book and movie deviate, you experience a different story.  If you've seen The Shining but haven't read it yet, I highly recommend doing so.
"
"
  I really like most of Steven Kings books and this one is no exception.  I decided to re-read the Shining before I got too deep into Dr. Sleep, the sequel.  Most people have seen the movie, The Shining, but the movie can't tell you what the characters are thinking or the reason for some of their actions/ reactions. Steven King's writing voice is very engaging and moves the reader into the world of his characters.  They come alive and you fear for their safety and sanity.  It's one of those books that is hard to put down, for fear you'll miss something.  And of course, staying up late, reading alone, in the quiet of your house,,,you kind of expect supernatural things to start happening!
"
"
  I have been in love with Stephen Kings books since I was 11.  IT was my first book and I have been a CONSTANT READER ever since.  The way he has of describing a child's thoughts and feelings and truly bringing out the love they have has always astounded me.  He helps me remember a a state of being that is so easy to forget in this cold cruel world.  I LOVE YOU MR KING!  MAY YOU ALWAYS SHINE ON!

  Well if you love Stephen King, you love Stephen King...I bought this as a gift for my nephew and after opening it was discovered theat there are a lot of creases and crimps in this cover and pages.  He wouldn't let me send it back though.

  I saw this book near the top of several lists rating Stephen King's novels, so I decided to read it.  I was not disappointed.  I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down.  I preferred to read it during the day, though.  There were several creepy things in the book that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  This was magnified when I read the book at night in a dark house.  King did a great job with the characters, and his descriptions of the hotel.  The way he described the hedge animals was excellent, especially when they were covered with snow.  After reading this book, I would hesitate to spend time during the winter months in any mountain hide-away hotel.  I would definitely recommend this book to other readers.

  After re-reading Stephen King’s classic, with 30 years having gone by since I read it the first time, I’m reminded how much I enjoyed the movie. The book just doesn’t compare. Stephen King has been writing bloated stories since the beginning, and the problem has only gotten worse as he’s aged. I doubt he’s ever used a single word or sentence to describe one of his wandering ideas when several dozen would do just fine.

  Great story and well written. Completely different from the movie and mini-series. The novel is better. The written word usually is better.There are some small editing problems, which is the reason for the loss of a star.

  Stephen King remains one of the best story tellers out there.  His imagination soars out of the confines of this world and into a sea of mystery, intrigue, and fright.  How fun.  This was a re-read for me having first read this title many years ago.  Stephen King has recently published a follow up book and I wanted to refresh my memory before reading the sequel.  I recall the fright that shook my soul the first time around and now I've been shaken again.  The Shining is just a classic scary book and King is king at writing them.  So, if you've never read The Shining and you enjoy the scary mysterious stuff, you should order it without delay.  Then you'll be ready for ""Doctor Sleep.""  Good luck!

  I really enjoyed reading The Shining for the first time. It was such a great book. I couldn't get over how different it was from the movie. I know all books are better and in ways different from film adaptations, but this was something else.
"
"
  Great Book!  However, for Brand New it came damaged like it was a used book. A little dissappointing. Book is 5 Stars, quality of the condition of ""New"" is 3 Stars.
"
"
  Like many people, I saw the movie but had never read the book. When Doctor Sleep (the book sequel) was published, I bought it and upon finishing it, I realized that I had to read the original. I'm glad that I did. For those who have not read the original but have seen the movie, as you read the book you will visualize the actors who played the parts. Of course redrum is there and you can see Jack swinging away at Wendy, Danny  and Mr Halloran. Much of the book and movie are consistent but the endings are different. The book is a fast read and once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended. Now that the book sequel has been published, its only a matter of time before a movie sequel is made. This time I'll have read the book before seeing the movie.

  I really enjoyed this book, although I had already seen the movie years earlier.  I had considered this, in movie form, to have been Stephen King's best work, but upon reading it, I feel it probablys stacks up with others for the most part.  I noted several differences from the movie, and actually feel that the book version was better because of these differences.  I""m not sure why the movie was made differently, other than probably to limit the length of the movie; and/or possibly the limitation in special effects technology at the time the Kubrick version of the movie was made.I will say that I think the ending of the movie was better than the ending in the book, but that's only my opinion.  I am glad that I finally got to read King's version of the story.
"
"
  This novel was a real treat.  I read Stephen King's ""On Writing"", and it made me want to read one of his novels.  I had not read one of his books since Junior High.  The Shining did not disappoint.  Stephen King really knows how to get inside a character's head, especially when that character has a murderous dark side.  One of the things I really liked about his character development is that he makes the characters seem real; but he just takes those dark thoughts normal people have one step further into the abyss.  I actually had nightmares while I was reading this book; finding myself staring my mortality in the face, etc...; if a novel has that kind of effect on me, it gets five stars in my book.After I read the book, I went ahead and watched the movie our of curiosity.  The movie pales in comparison to the book; isn't that normally the case?  The depth of character is just not in the movie.
"
"
  Primarily the beginning of the book, but throughout the entire book the author delves into extremely painful detail. It is also very repetitive. If you can overcome this enough to finish the book it is worth it, but the build-up is far too drawn out.
"
"
  I saw the movie as a kid and the 3 part series more recently. The series was much more accurate and I highly recommend it. The book however is even better than I imagined. The story is more rich in detail and explanation. Highly recommend!
"
"
  Have seen Stanley Kubrick's screen rendition several times, I decided to finally read the book (as the book is always so much better).  At the time I had seen the movies, I was under the impression that the movie fit close to the movie, not being aware of the war between King and Kubrick.After having read the book, I gotta say....the movie was horrible and did not do the book justice.  The book actually terrified me in certain parts!  I realize there is a movie out there more closer to King's story, but I think I am just going to stick with the experience from the book.  The Shining is King at his best!!!
"
"
  I had never really been interested in king before but was reading this with friends. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. It has a lot of symbolism and is deep enough to keep our conversations going well into the night.
"
"
  Bow to the master! No one can match the powerful descriptions of terror like King. His language not ok only takes you to the setting, it puts you right inside as a character-allowing every fear to feel as if it is your own.
"
"
  This is one of my very favorite King novels. I've read The Shining probably over 10 times and each time not only does it scare the crap out of me, but I seem to enjoy it more than the previous reading and take more out of the story. I not only love it for the story itself, but because it takes place in my home state of Colorado starting in Boulder and then moving up into the Rockies. Sidewinder is a fictional town where the Overlook Hotel is located, but if you visit Estes Park, Colorado you will find The Stanley Hotel on Overlook Drive which is haunted as well ;-)I just finished reading Doctor Sleep which is the follow up novel to The Shining and I am really happy to know where Danny and Wendy landed after the Overlook and Sidewinder.The Shining is a superb and haunting tale and for those of you with a little 'shine' in ya, I know you'll connect with this book that same way I did.Enjoy it!!

  If you have seen the famous movie from 1980 by the same name, you really do need to read this book. It provides better background information and is more meaningful than the film. I am somewhat disappointed to say that, having read the book, my opinion on the movie is somewhat negative now, simply because of the facts it leaves out and/or changes. Certain people that do die in the movie do not get killed in the novel , and the ending itself is much more climactic than the film's resolution.The only complaint that I might have is that there are certain points in the book where King seems to ""ramble"" at times. Some readers might get bored with this, although it didn't bother me at all. It is still definitely worth the read.
"
"
  I love the movie adaptation of this book but I had not read the book until recently and let me just say guys, it's way better. There some huge differences and God I wish the movie had stuck with book story more. So many amazing scenes depicted wonderfully by Stephen King.This is my first Stephen King book and what stuck out the most is the way he described the characters and he really takes his time in developing them. Very impressed with his writing. I mean I knew he was a great writer based on his popularity but getting to experience it myself was awesome.
"
"
  OK, so I know this novel has been around a long time, but either I missed reading it decades ago, or I read it and forgot--which at my age is a distinct possibility.Once the premise of the book was layed out, it was repeated in various permutations so often that it took a little persistence on my part to keep reading.  I think this may have been because the cast of characters was relatively small.  Once the story moved along to the hotel, however, the burner was turned up and the story really started to cook.  By the end of the book, I couldn't read fast enough.  I found the ending to be very satisfying.I read this book now in anticipation of reading Dr. Sleep, which I understand includes the little boy from The Shining.  As long as Stephen King keeps writing, I'll keep reading.
"
"
  For some reason, this is one of the few King books I had not read yet. Perhaps since I have seen the movie several times and loved it. I know SO himself has been said to dislike the movie, so curiosity lead me to dive in. I'm glad I did. Better than the movie by far. I'll have trouble sleeping tonight.
"
"
  This is one of my favorite novels. I read it 20 years ago in middle school and then recently reread it on Kindle to get ready for Dr. Sleep. I read this book outside on a beautiful humid sunny day in Iowa (I am middle aged) and it scared the jeepers out of me. It scared me more now than it did when I was a kid because I understand the plot and other elements of the book so much more. There are already over 1000 reviews on Amazon for this book so I won't digress into a long review about the plot. My favorite character is Halloran. I wasn't too happy the Kubrick movie gave him a quick and unseemly demise. If you watched the Kubrick movie and it scared you, the novel is even scarier!
"
"
  I decided to read The Shining in anticipation of reading Doctor Sleep.  $1.99 for the Kindle version. Can't beat that.This was far from my favorite King book. It takes a while to get rolling. The second half picks up though, making it worth reading if you are a fan.I think the main difficulty is the fact that I have seen the movie many times before reading the book. The movie is great imo, but quite different in some key ways from the book. I could not help but picture the movie cast while reading, even where the descriptions don't match up. That created enough of a distraction that I could never totally settle into it.  That's not the fault of the book of course, but something the new reader might want to consider.

  Captures much of the complicated relationship between a father and a young son, then twists the father past the breaking point. Also does a great job of portraying believable ESP (well, possibly, anyway ... depending on your own experiences and beliefs). The ending to me doesn't quite live up to the build up (anyway, he used a similar ending in his first book Carrie) and there are a few places where he pushes things a bit too hard and loses me on the ""suspension of disbelief"" scale. Still, a great horror book and well worth reading ... actually this is a great novel and well worth reading!
"
"
  The Shining. If you haven't heard about it, you've been stuck down in a 50's nuclear fallout shelter. It's no secret that King struggled with Alcoholism for years. One of his best quotes, I think from, ""On Writing""  was when he quit drinking.  ""I was miserable.  I didn't want to be drunk, and I didn't want to be sober.""  In the Shining, the main character suffers from the same, and it turns out this chink in his armor was it all it took, to set him off.  Of course, the story is about what triggered him... That's where it's King at his best.
"
"
  I finished this book months ago but never did a review. As you can see from other reviewers it is a good book. The story telling was fantastic and I was able to imagine every scene through the details that the author provided. I really liked this family but the dad definitely had to go. He became too creepy and there was no going back.Everything that was going on inside the hotel was so juicy that I didn't want to read the other parts of Mr. Halloran. ;)In one chapter, the dad is eating some crackers that I had never heard of and then days later my mom brought those same crackers mentioned from the store. It was funny and creepy.
"
"
  It has been years since I read this book. I love the story and the characters. There were a few things I missed the first few times I read it but caught this time. I cannot wait to watch the movie again too.
"
"
  Went to The Stanley Hotel for a day tour today (Abbie, you're an awesome tour guide!!! ) & after learning more about how the story got wrote, I decided it was time to re-read this classic. I still like Kubrick's movie best above other renditions tho. SK you're still one of my fave authors!!! <U+0001F601>

  Only the second novel written and published under King's name, and not as Richard Bachman, it is clear that King now has grown into his craft. ""The Shining"" remains one of the most frightening of King's books, and accomplishes something that the King novels of today are incapable of doing:  presenting intricately flawed characters in less than 1,000 pages.  The characters of Jack & Danny, and Jack's influence of Danny's development into an adult (which one reads about in ""Dr. Sleep"") are nothing short of brilliant.  As is always the case, the book offers the reader so much more than the movie or the TV mini-series derived from it.  A staple in the King/Bachman enthusiast's library!  Buy it today!
"
"
  I haven't read the book, though I want to. I bought it for my best friend, who requested ""children's books to grow her collection"" for her babyshower. I thought ""baby's first horror story"" worked well and she loved it. The book was absolutely beautiful when it arrived, good condition, and I'm pleased with the smile it got on my best friend's face which was the goal.
"
"
  The book "" The Shining"" was recommended by our college professor for Eng 101 course. After receiving this book I was disappointed to see that edges of this book had been cut so close to the writing that most of the words were missing. I did not have the time to return so I just bought a new at the local book store. It was just a waste of money and time.
"
"
  So sick! I started this novel when Covid-19 was starting and just finished it today a day after everything would supposedly end and it has lightened the load of the darkness around me. I love this story and I actually read most of it in a deserted giant hotel in Mexico at the start of the pandemic. This was when traveling was not recommended. I put myself in the story as I always do and this novel was the most intense walkthrough ever. I love it thank you King!

  Many people are naturally more immersed in books, than they are media such as movies and video games. The original Stanley Kubrick movie was good, but essentially was it's own movie.  Stephen King notoriously HATES that movie adaptation, and for good reason.  It's not bad, but this book is just so much more than the film ever could be.  It's gripping and intense to say the least, and gave me feelings of adrenaline (in a good way) that I haven't had in years.  While the made for television mini-series was a more faithful adaptation of the book, it still fails miserably to capture the magic waiting for you in these pages.  If you are a fan of horror/thrillers/suspense, do yourself a favor and purchase this book!

"
  I never read The Shining, only saw the movie and it scared the bejeebus out of me. So... I read the SEQUEL FIRST - Doctor Sleep and THEN went back and read The Shining. It was a perfect way to do it for me. Doctor Sleep gave me some background that I never really put together in the movie, so when I went back to read the book, I was amazed at how much detail was left out. Of course, a true Stephen King movie would be days long, so I get it, but I really enjoyed reading it finally and I have decided the ONLY way to read Stephen King is on my Kindle - no more balancing a 10 pound book and when my eyes get tired, I just increase the font size to read a little more.
"
"
  The first time I read The Shining, I read most of it in one night. I simply couldn’t put it down.Understand, it’s not Great Literature with lofty moral perspectives, but it’s a whale of a story. it’s almost impossible to be unmoved by this little kid - only five! - and throughout the gradually developing nightmare, you remain connected and empathetic with this boy.I’ve re-read this book several times over the years and it holds up beautifully.Well done Mr. King!
"
"
  I'm not a fan of horror movies and prior to reading this book have not seen the whole movie because i've considered it part of the horror genre.I've been reading Stephen King books for several years and liked them all. After finishing Salem's Lot and feeling that it didn't meet my expectations in terms of scare factor, I thought I'd try The Shining and it didn't disappoint. As usual, King builds great complex characters at the start of the book but then comes in the Overlook Hotel and the ghosts in the machine and that is when the tide turns and things go wrong for Danny.
"
"
  Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and The Shining is one of my favorite of his full novels. It has many allegories and analogies that children who experience childhood trauma experience. It's eerie and unsettling, but also really beautiful. A necessary King read.
"
"
  I first saw the movie and hated it! Then I had a summer of boredom and decided to give the book a try knowing that I liked Stephen King and that often his plots are too big for a movie. I love the book, much more than I thought I would, I would suggest it to anyone. I won't say that I was scarred because I think that I watch and read too much horror that I don't ever feel afraid to turn out my lights. I miss that feeling so my search continues for a book like that! But I will say that there were some creepy parts that did not translate well into movie and were much scarier in the book.
"
"
  I’ve seen The Shining movie several times. After reading the book, I’d like to watch the movie, again.  The book was a fun read, many twists & turns. The book & movie are different, which for this reader, made it pretty interesting! Hard to put down.
"
"
  I stopped on page 108 to write this review. Please, please, it can't be this boring , can it? I am usually diving into pages of good books; IT was like that but not this one. I'll change my review if it gets any better. can't believe I'm reading a bestseller( the only good point is that I paud only $8 , so thank u Amazon Prime ))

  Summary: The Shining is about a man named Jack who takes on a job as a caretaker for the Overlook hotel. His wife Wendy and son Danny have agreed to go with him but as they start to settle in for winter strange things start to happen within the hotel.My Thoughts: This book I thought was good but not great. There was parts that were very creepy and eerie, however I just wasn't as invested in the story as I would have liked to be. I have to say I did not like Jack's character he was my least favorite but I really loved Mr. Hallorann (aka. Dick) and Danny (aka. Doc). This is the first book I have read by Stephen King and despite the 3 star rating I gave this book I will still be checking out his other books.
"
"
  I had never read the book before, but had images in my head from the movie. There is a world of difference between the two.The best thing about the book is that the characters in the are so well-developed. I cared about them, and that's what made it so suspenseful.There actually is very little action in this book, but it still kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting for that moment when it would break through.The only thing I didn't like about the book was that the main story was so good, I found that I didn't care about the chapters with Halloran later on. I just wanted to skip them and go back to the hotel! That's a good problem though!It's a classic. Read it and enjoy it.
"
"
  While I won’t share the differences, because I don’t spoil things like a brat, I liked the ending better in the book and it expanded on a couple things the movie showed giving it better context.
"
"
  Absolutely loved the actual plot and storyline of the Shining. However I had multiple issues when I received the physical paperback edition. When I opened the box the corner pages were bent, the front and back cover were ripped in multiple places, and the entire thing was covered in dust. I’ve never had this problem before. This copy must have come from the Overlook hotel because the condition was awful

  Each year, the leader of our book club picks a Halloween appropriate book for October.  This year, The Shining got the nod.  Having already read the books years ago and having seen the movie, I thought I would skim through the book to refresh my memory.  I got hooked.  The development of characters and the building of suspense by Stephen King underscores why he is the master storyteller.Stephen King is an alcoholic . . . in recovery.  The book revolves around the decisions and demons of a man who is an alcoholic.  Knowing what we now know about King, those passages take on a greater significance.Brilliant!
"
"
  I am a fan of the movie, and after watching Dr. Sleep, I wanted more details about the story.The book of course is different from the movie, I like them both! The details and background of the characters bring so much more meaning to the story.
"
"
  All my life I've heard about the shining and how scary of a book it is. I've always wanted to read it and finally got the courage to do so. I was slightly disappointed. It's a really great book, but I think the bar was set too high as far as the spookiness. I'm not sure if I just don't have that much of an imagination, but it wasn't all that scary. Disturbing absolutely, but not terrifying. Overall it's a really great book and I'm happy Stephen King wrote something of a sequel for it.
"
"
  I used to be a die hard King fan and then I moved on to other authors.This was one of his book's I had not read in the past and decided to pick it up once Doctor Sleep came out.Okay who hasn't seen The Shining, the original or the remake?  I will say this...the book IS BETTER!!!This is classic King.I will say at times while reading I did imagine NIcholson or Duvall portraying the characters.  I wish I would have read the book before ever watching the movies, but one cannot undue what has been seen or read.REDRUM...REDRUM...
"
"
  Jack and Wendy take there 5 year old, Danny, with them to spend the winter in a large hotel where Jack is the off-season care taker.  Located in the mountains of Colorado, the famous hotel houses more than the guest on the register. Often chilling and sometimes terrifying, I couldn't put it down.  Excellent characters, plot and writing.  Love it!I never really planned to read this one after seeing the movie, but I decided to before reading ""Doctor Sleep"". The only things the book and movie have in common are the title and the hotel.  That's about it.  There's so much more in the book.
"
"
  I know that books are always better than films, but this one blew my mind away. As a Film Appreciation teacher, I had seen, and studied, the film many times. I thought that reading the book would be just another way of watching the film. Boy, was I wrong.I can't say that one is better than the other, because the film is an interpretation of this story and each is its own art form with its merits and characteristics. Kubrick was a master of moving pictures and King is a master with words.King is one of the most engaging writers I have ever read. I did not want to put the book down. Every moment not reading was torture.Now, I want to read every Stephen King book.
"
"
  I read ""The Shining"" when it was first released. It was the first time I read a book that I just couldn't put down. I was practically hypnotized by this scary yet clever horror story about a haunted hotel. But, after reading it a second time 30 years later, I find the book is even better than I remembered. The first time I read ""The Shining"", I focused on the supernatural events and didn't appreciate the slow and steady reveal of the back story and the subtle nuances of the character development. Now I realize ""The Shining"" is so much more than a horror story about a haunted hotel. It is also a story about dysfunctional family dynamics, love, determination, loyalty, and much, much more. An exciting yet meaningful story with complex characters.
"
"
  I'm a long time fan of Stephen king, although never read his first novels; started with Pet Cemetery. I recently purchased the sequel to The Shining and was confused by the first chapter, then realized I was basing what I knew by the movie, so I decided to read the original first and it was worth it. I think The Shining is one of his best and scariest books. His scariest is ""It"", in my opinion, but without his sci-fi endings. If you have only seen the movie, you are missing out on a lot of details from the book. Spoiler alert for the book... the maze (labyrinth) on the grounds of the hotel isn't even in the book. It was just a made up Hollywood scene.  Read The Shining and find out what else was left out.
"
"
  I really love this book, I consider it one of King's best books.  It has a creepy hotel and the characters are great.  This is one you want to keep the lights on for when you read it.  Stephen King wrote a sequel nand it's not bad.  It is not a rehash of The Shining, but let's you into Danny Torrence's live many years later, but I digress.  The Shining is great because of all the characters the Overlook Hotel and it's hauning past is the star of the book. it seems to feed off weakness, dependance and it takes advantage of the familes isolation to get what it wants.  A really great horror read.  Well done Mr. King.
"
"
  While reading my very first book by legendary author Stephen King it absolutely did not surprise me that a number of passages within the pages of The Shining were extremely well written. What did shock me however, was just how needlessly long the book itself really is.Yeah, The Shining is a great book, with compelling characters and the kind of omnipresent creep factor that everyone expects from a horror genre master the likes of Stephen King, but for yours truly, the biggest surprise of all was the fact that, while slogging my way through the book's 660 pages, at least a good half of it actually seems to be composed of more or less extraneous information that doesn't always do all that much to move the story along.Sure, some of King's wordy ruminations and seemingly endless details feel like they're actually necessary and productive story-wise, but a whole lot of the rest just simply does not do much more than slow down (or even hobble) the whole bloody shebang. In fact, I honestly think the book could have been edited down to a third of its final length without scrimping on the genuine meat in this particular horror sandwich.But I somehow made it through to the end, of course. And although I will always wish that the author's publisher had pressured the man to produce a tighter, much more succinct thriller than the one now forever committed to pop culture posterity, I am still mostly satisfied with the experience. I cannot say, however, that the Shining is really all that scary, shocking, or even suspenseful.But I suppose the book, just as it is and ever shall be, is good enough to merit its place in contemporary literary history. And that's something, I guess. I just wish it hadn't taken me so damn long to read, and that I hadn't been quite so tempted to abandon the endeavor altogether throughout so very much of the overly lengthy entirety of it.
"
"
  This is the ultimate haunted house novel. King realized something that few writers understood; Ghosts are boring. It is not the house or the haunters that drive a good horror novel but the hauntees. Jack Torrance is the perfect foil for an evil house. He is troubled and unsure of himself. He is a time bomb waiting to go off with just the right push and the overlook Hotel knows it. King shows in this book that he is the master of the slow build. The Shining is not just a great supernatural novel. It is a great psychological thriller.
"
"
  A great read!!  I always thought that I couldn’t read anything in the horror genre because the movies scare me too badly. But now that I know I can, I’m going back and reading some old classics. I wasn’t disappointed.
"
"
  I read this years ago in college, and it stands up.  King crafts his stories so well.  He brings in themes and leitmotifs that resonate throughout.  In The Shining, one of those leitmotifs is ""the pup"" who has to ""take his medicine.""I re-read The Shining because I just read Dr. Sleep, and realized I needed to reacquaint myself with the Torrances.  So I re-read The Shining and then re-read Dr. Sleep, because I knew it would make so much more sense this time.  Danny Torrance is a wonderful character.  Everybody needs to get to know Danny Torrance as King originally portrayed him, not the half-wit Kubrik made him out to be.
"
"
  I grew up watching the movie the shining with Jack Nicholson.  I just now have gotten around to reading the book and like the differences between the two.  I would recommend to anyone looking for classic Stephen King. 5 stars for the easy-to-get-to-know characters, including the hotel.
"
"
  I know how great the movie it's, being a horror classic, with the mesmerizing performance of Jack Nicholson, the direction of Stanley, Kubrick, ""Here's Johnny"", etc, etc.  But I have to admit that I felt something was missing.  And that was the true shining,  the gift Danny and Mr. Halloran had.  If you have the same curiosity as I did,  you must read the book.  It does explore it depth.  I don't want to spoiled the experience for anyone.  That's what I can only say this is a beatiful story of redemption.  Pay good attention to all the symbols.  You might find healing for  your own demons.  Just like I did.
"
"
  I wouldn't argue with someone who said this was Stephen King's finest work. It is an undeniable masterpiece that defines who Stephen King is as a novelist. All of the elements of Stephen King's strengths come through in great form here:1. All the main characters are intricately defined, you get to see and understand why they are the way they are. The movie is excellent but the book presents backgrounds on Jack and Wendy that define them much more effectively than the movie does.2. A well-presented location that is completely entwined in the dark terrors the novel presents.3. A satisfying, epic conclusion.
"

  The Shining was Stephen King's third published novel and tells the story of Jack Torrance and his family after Jack takes a job as winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel. We quickly learn that Jack has a history of losing his temper and getting into trouble and the caretaker's job is something of a last chance for him to rebuild his life. His wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, are the only other people in the hotel for the winter... the only other living people that is. Some unpleasant spirits also populates the Overlook and they've decided that they want the Torrance's to join their club. I don't want to give away any more of the plot for those few who have never seen the movie or read the book, but suffice to say that the family faces quite a struggle to survive their time at the hotel.I often enjoy Stephen King's books but I also don't find many of them to be particularly scary. More often, they are compelling character studies with a bit of suspense. Not so, The Shining. This is a genuine horror story and provides plenty of white-knuckle moments as you read through it. The character development is still there, but the suspense is more intense and prolonged than we usually get from King.While a good deal of the story centers on Jack, his son Danny is the counterbalance that makes the book work so well. He has a remarkable gift (called the shining) that allows him to see glimpses of the future as well as sense the thoughts of those around him. But at five years old, he is far too young to wield his power effectively against the hotel and he can't bear to accept what his visions show him about his father. As his father descends into madness and the ghosts get more aggressive, the odds grow increasingly long against Danny's survival.The Shining is an easy book to recommend. It has remained one of Stephen King's most popular books ever since it was published 30 years ago for good reason. It's one of his best efforts and has a more timeless quality than most of his works. If you're looking for a good scare, give it a try.

  I had seen Kubrick's movie adaptation years prior to reading the novel.  The movie is excellent, but this book is in a class of exactly one: itself.King does a wonderful job of drawing the reader in, and keeping the pace lively and interesting throughout.  I don't spook easily.  However, there were several evenings, reading in bed, during which the palpable sense of dread that this novel elicits had me looking around my dark bedroom and wincing nervously whenever I heard a sound in the house.The Shining is obviously a ""classic,"" but I'd go one further and call it a masterpiece.  IMO, this is quite possibly THE single most perfect horror novel of all time.

  I had always heard that the movie was better than the book. What a load of bull. The book is sooooo much better. The movie will always be a classic, but it should be called something different and all different names... it’s so different from the book. The movie is a good scare. But the book is a great spooky story.

  20 years ago, I read this book as a teenager, and at the time it was to me a great horror novel with really awesome scenes. I loved the supernatural elements of the story, the violent set pieces, and the sheer aggression of the writing.Now, I just finished reading it again as a family man who has a wife and three children. And it was like reading an entirely different book. The violent set pieces, the aggression, the slick supernatural elements, they're all still there, but I now recognize the real horror of the book — the demons the man Jack wrestles with. The demons that all men fight, the ones I recognize in myself oh so well:  that endless need for self-gratification, the battle with pride, and of course, the horrific compulsion towards vice as a salve for the pain of living .In other words, this book is about the human condition — our desperate, festering unhappiness, and the deep spiritual emptiness within us. The Shining is about the battle for a man's soul in the absence of God. Like all art, it, too, is ultimately about God, our need for him, and the ravages of a life without Him.

"
  Great King book! They always seem to have the same good endings though. Good guy wins - bad guy dies. Even if ending was predictable, the entire book kept me on my toes.
"
"
  This was probably the 3rd time I've read The Shining over the last 15 years. The movie was also great and suspenseful. The book is even better! Although I know what will happen, I still enjoy the scariest journey word by word. It's truly a classic book-good enough to scare you more than once. I'm not a huge Stephen King fan---but he has some of the best books that make me scared to be home alone! (I'm 55 years old) My other favorites are Misery & Delores Claiborne. (hope I spelled her name correctly) He is a one of a kind writer and has the ability to scare & frighten me, regardless of how logical I want to be!
"
"
  I enjoyed both movies, but they don't come close to the book. It's rich and full of insight on the backgrounds, personalities, and view points of the characters- much more than the movies could offer. In the book I liked how it goes into depth, how determined Jack was to make things workout in his marriage and new job. His love for his family shined (no pun intended) through the pages and let you have a more personal involvement. It was refreshing how Wendy's character came to life as this strong beautiful woman who has an active mind and role...much more realistic than a wimpy simple looking gal as portrayed in the first film. It's a must read for all!
"
"
  Even if you have seen the movie based on this book, you are going to love the read. Being inside each of the characters’ minds and understanding what is happening with each of them, written in King’s inimitable style will have you staying up late and turning pages to the very end. Woohoo...what a ride!
"
"
  This is the second time I’ve read this classic and it’s been several years in between readings, but this book was as creepy and crawly as I remember. Stephen King has no equal when it comes to evoking spine tingling fear with words. A true master of his craft. A national treasure.
"
"
  I wish they would remake the movie and put in all the amazing things they left out of! The ending was so different than I would of guessed. I really love this book and really creepy but loved it! I was glued to my screen the whole time!
"
"
  I have always loved the Stanley Kubrick film adaptation of The Shining. So I naturally gravitated to this being my first Stephen King novel. It has great writing and wonderful imagery. Making you feel as though your an invisible bystander in the Overlook Hotel with them. I chose to read this book while working in Boulder, Colorado (in fact I got quite frightened a number of times by customers walking in). I feel as though that added a certain eerieness air to the book. However, the writing is so good that I feel you would be scared no matter where you are. Wonderful King starter book!
"
"
  I don’t think anything I share will say anything about this book than has already been said. So I’ll just say that the people who love it are right, it’s extraordinary.
"
"
  It had been 20+ years since I head read ""The Shining"" and I don't think I was old enough at the time to appreciate the genius of Stephen King and his writing.  Reading about Jack's slow decent into madness, whether or not it was caused by alcohol or the hotel or both, is pure artistry.  Reading King's work of the last few years made me forget how much I really, really loved his early work and why I became a fan of his in the first place.  This is a fantastically written novel and I enjoyed reading it all over again.  Perhaps more so, this time around.
"
"
  Listening to the book made a person feel like they were actually there. I saw the movies and read the book years ago but having someone read it to me is even better.
"
"
  What an amazing imagination King has. This is a marvelous read. I’m glad I’ve read it. Almost didn’t.It’s worth the time, even if you’ve seen the film.
"
"
  I had heard King's ""The Shining"" was very different from Kubrick's movie version, and it's true, but each has its own strengths. Would be a good discussion exercise for a literature class or book club! I thought King captured a kid's fears very well; some of the most suspenseful and frightening parts were from Danny's point of view. Jack's downward spiral is well-rendered, and the minor characters are also given some nice depth. Even in an age of wireless communications, the sense of isolation at the Overlook still feels palpable and relate-able. Impressive that this was King's first attempt to do psychological horror. Highly recommended!
"
"
  I believe this is the best Stephen King book ever.  I'd actually read it years before, in paperback, and wanted to own the hardcover.  Some of the scenes have stuck in my head since way back when I first read The Shining, especially the bathroom scene when Jack goes in to investigate that tub.  You know the scene.  Creepy as hell!  Hearing that shower curtain clank when Jack knew he'd not drawn it back across the tub.  Seeing that doorknob twisting as someone or something tried to get out.  Creepy!The Shining kept me on the edge of my seat.  It is one of those few books that I just could not put down.
"
"
  This was the first book I've read of Steven kings. I must say that I'm impressed. I've always been a fan of the movie but this book is thrilling to say the least
"
"
  This book is amazing! Totally holds up to the hype and makes the movie seem like a piece of crap in comparison! All hail Stephen King!  As for the actual book, nice print, sturdy cover for a hard back, some folded pages from manufacturing but its not noticeable. Good size for binge reading!
"
"
  As a first time King reader, I only had a faint idea as to what to expect when picking up The Shining for the very first time. Since I've been a huge fan of the film for as long as I could remember, I was slightly reluctant to check out the book version. But after reading that last page my skepticism was put to rest. This book was thrilling, heavy, intense, spooky, and sometimes funny. The characters are well curated, and King doesn't waste many pages laboring over any needless details. Overall, the setting was perfect for the story and provided the perfect cocoon for the characters to wrestle with their demons. I highly recommend this title to anyone, especially fans of suspense/horror, as well as those who've seen the film but haven't checked out the print. I highly doubt there's any King fans who haven't digested this beast by now. If you haven't there's no need to fret. It was worth the wait.
"
"
  I saw the movie when it first came out, but I had never read the book. I was surprised by how well-written and literary the writing was. It was decently paced, and the tension built to the end. A very enjoyable read (vastly superior to Salem's Lot).There is certainly the scary stuff, but it is not up in your face until about three-quarters of the way through. To a large extent, it is a statement of the modern family, how domestic violence permeates society and affects us as we grow up with it. It deals with matters of addiction and selfishness, and other things. It contains subtlety, nuance, and metaphor. Well worth the read, even if you think of yourself as only a reader of literary fiction.
"
"
  I read this book several years ago but I am so glad  I re-read it before starting Stephen King's sequel to this book called ""Dr. Sleep"" which continues the story of Dan Torrance as an adult.This book just takes you into the characters flaws as well as their humanity. It can be a bit gory at times but that goes hand in hand with the story.I feel this is one of the best books I have ever read and know I will read it several times in the future.Do yourself a favor and give this book a try even if you don't think it is 'your kind of book.' The characterization and non-stop suspense will keep you turning the pages.Stephen King is a national treasure.
"
"
  If you loved the movie then you will love the book even more. King creates characters that you instantly fall in love with and care about, no matter what they do. For example, in the movie you do not get to fully understand the love he has for his wife and son. In the book you get to fully experience his life before and after the hotel, and it makes for a much better story.King also creates amazing scenes where you do get scared, and that cannot be found in many books these days, and anyone who loves King books knows what I'm talking about.If your looking for a good story or your a constant reader you need to read this book.
"
"
  OMG Stephen King what else do you say..... This book  Wow.  Ok so saw the movie long time ago and nothing compared to the book.  Thrilling captivating just wow.  Awesome read.
"
"
  Another magnificent novel from Stephen King,  At times the tension is just unbearable, and you wish it could end just so you can breathe!
"
"
  I wasn't that scared. I have always heard people say the Shining is sooo scary so I bought this book and watched the movie. Maybe it was scarier a long time ago but to me, I wasn't scared at all. In regards to both the movie and the book, it picks up so slow that I lose my interests when the ""scary"" part comes. Meh..
"
"
  Book is better than the movie & I’m a huge fan of the movie. Highly recommend to give this a read. It’s a page turner so you’ll breeze through it quickly
"
"
  Having just visited the Stanley hotel (overlook) I had to read The Shining. This story is so vivid that I'm glad I hadn't read the story first!
"
"
  I was hesitant about starting the book given that I had seen the movie. That was not an issue at all.  The book diverges from the movie with in a few pages.
"
"
  I read the entire book in one day! It is so much more interesting than the movie. I can see why King didn’t particularly care for Kubrick’s interpretation.
"
"
  On reading the Shining, I found that another one of my favorite movies once again failed to come close to the quality of the novel it was based on.  King's Shinning, althought now a little dated, hits the mark for those looking for an entertaining and frightening read. King quickly pulls his readers into the characters' worlds, allowing time for identifying with them before the fun (or terror) begins. The Shinings biggest character is in fact the haunted mountain top hotel called the Overlook and Kings writing allows the reader to clearly see this cursed venue in the mind's eye. The books enjoyment is greatly enhanced if read alone, at night, and during the dark winter months.But, as in many of King's novels, he tends to end his story in a rushed and haphazard way, tieing up his loose ends a little to conveniently. The Shining is a great example of this, which is why 4/5 stars are given.With that said, I still consider The Shining one of his best and a must read for any horror fan.
"
"
  A horror literature masterpiece worthy of sharing the bookshelf with Shelley's Frankenstein and Stoker's Dracula. My apologies Mr. King for ever doubting your brilliance. It's unfortunate that for many people the mention of ""The Shining"" conjures up the pale imitation of a movie adaptation from Stanley Kubrick. The movie lacked the human characterization found in the novel, Jack is more sympathetic and tragic as he descends into madness, Wendy is the brave wife and mother, and Danny is the true focus and hero of the story. If you just know the movie, you're missing out on so much.
"
"
  Had t read this in decades.  It was even better then I remembered.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good haunted house tale
"
"
  My advice:1. If you already watched the movie, read the book anyway! There are VERY big differences in the storyline, and the book explains many things that were a mystery in the movie. Probably the most interesting parts are the backstory of the hotel, such as the lady in the bathtub, and the life of Jack Torrance. Most importantly, dismiss any thoughts of having the book ""spoiled"" by the movie, because believe me the suspense will be there - because of the way it's written, and because the endings aren't the same! I found the book more frightening and suspenseful, truth be told, though the movie was amazing as well.2. The beginning will be slow as the characters are introduced. Bear with it! A bit later on it becomes a lot faster and you'll be glad you didn't drop it at 15% or so.
"
"
  After finally seeing the movie all the way through I thought the boom must be pretty good so I ordered it that day. The book arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It was bigger than I thought it was but the larger print is great for me. My eye sight is rubbish. I habe not read it yet but it looks to be in great condition.
"
"
  The book was better than the movie... but I really didn’t enjoy the writing style.  I did a lot os skim reading to get to the “thought” being written.
"
"
  This book took me forever to read. It's slow-going at first, and a lot of the real action doesn't happen until the end. However, I think you glean more from the book than the movie when it comes to the characters' personalities and inner thoughts/desires, which I always find to be cool and interesting. It definitely isn't the best Stephen King book I've read, but it's worth reading if you have the time.
"
"
  Unfortunately, I watched the movie before reading the book. That gave Jack Nicholson's face to my mental scenes when Jack Torrence was getting mad. Although Nicholson did a great job, I reckon King's stunning narration would make my mind imagine an even scarier version of Jack Torrence... A real page turner that send me straight away to the sequel...
"
"
  Quite different from the film. The film has a Kubrick style to it which the novel didn't. Some scenes from the novel would make you gasp harder!  The film however makes you open your eyes wide. The novel is more violent.
"
"
  I am a big Stephen King fan. Have read all of his books, except for a few short stories. When I realized that his next book coming out in the fall was the sequel to the Shining, I also realized I had never read it. So  I bought it. It is a scary tale. Sorry it took so long for me to get to it.It will keep you interested until the end, and it is set up to make you wonder what happens to the characters later.There is one other question it posed for me. Did Mr. King know about quantum theory when this was written? It is a good attempt to explain what is happening in our world if that theory is correct.
"
"
  It is striking how much better the book is than the movie was (jack Nicholson notwithstanding). Such an intense story, and multi-faceted characters that do not act out of character. This book has also provided the strong foundation formDanny as an adult (Dr. Sleep--thank you Stephen!). Highly recommended- but you knew that.
"
"
  I have read this book multiple times since its orginal publication and it has never disapponted me. If you've only seen the film versions of this story, run, do not walk, to your nearest bookstore or to your computer, and get yourself a copy of this book.  There really aren't words that describe how well crafted this psychological thriller/horror novel is.  I know the story and am still terrified when rereading the novel.  King is a master at this kind of horror and this is one of his finest books.  Its a classic and deserves a space in your home library.  Enjoy!  I wish I could read it for a ""first time"" again!
"
"
  I very much enjoyed the characters in this book, with every one of them being fully fleshed out. However, don’t go thinking that this is like the movie. This is much different, in a darker, more sinister way that Stephen King is known for. If you’re a fan of that, you’ll enjoy this classic.
"
"
  This novel came out when I was just a kid. I can recall a friend who said that, after he read it one summer on vacation, he refused to use the hotel bathrooms for the remainder of the book.  I can see why.Stephen King's The Shining is part horror, part fiction, and part autobiographical. His understanding of Jack Torrance's drinking problem is, at least in part, related to his own struggles with alcohol.Here, he is at the top of his game. Worth reading over and over.
"
"
  A bit dull and slow for my taste, but then again, I'm used to a different kind of novels and genre. But its a good and interesting read, the development of the main character (Jack) and how the ghosts get to him and turn what could had been a great family getaway, into a horrific and traumatic winter.
"
"
  Over the summer, I read this book during camp. I had heard about The Shining through all of my friends, and they were all reading it and were telling me how interesting it was. I tried reading the book out, and I fell in love with it! It blew away my expectations. My parents had always told me that this book was a horror book and compared to horror movies, this book was a walk in the park. I have read Stephen King before, so I know how he gives many characters strange traits. I liked how you could not figure out what was wrong with Jack Torrance until the middle of the book. You only knew that he had an incident at his previous job as a teacher. I think that anyone older than 13 can read it because before then, children will not grasp the whole point of the book and about what the characters are speaking of. People who get frightened easily should definitely shouldn't read the book.
"
"
  I read this book due to the fact that I was going to stay at The Stanley Hotel for a weekend trekking Rocky Mountains National Park. The hotel lobby was superb and rightfully described on the book. The book pace was good but a little predictive. I guess the author could have make more of a twist at the end. Anyhow the book did provide enjoyment back at the hotel after some exhausting days walking the Park.
"
"
  I actually read this book a many years ago, and thought it was a good book. After reading it again, I once again savored the time invested in this classic Stephen King novel. The book leaves you cheering for an unfortunate young boy, as he traverses awful events in his ESP ridden life, with lost innocence and courage.I wanted to revisit this novel, before reading Doctor Sleep which picks up the the story of Danny better known as Doc as a young boy. I can only hope the author doesn't screw this up like the The Dark Tower. King's accident sadly affected his craft, so glad he survived, yet his books seem fractured and when reading some of his current work his books as easy to set down. A suggestion of a good read for consideration would be the author Joe Hill, his son. In time he will. give his Pops a run for his money, and that's a lot of dough.
"
"
  For a book that has three main characters stuck in a hotel for most of the story, I thought this was very well done. Saw the movie before I read the book so I was never really interested in this story. I am very glad that I went for it. Loved the idea of the shining and the context that this added to some of his later works, but I don't know that I enjoyed this as much as The Dark Tower series, Hearts in Atlantis, Salem's Lot, or 11/26/63 (the JFK book because I know I got that date wrong). Those are my personal favorite King stories, but this novel definitely is able to stand up on its own merits.
"
"
  An early Stephen King with all of the elements he conjures to make his stories whole.  If you have seen the movie , do yourself a favor and read the story. And, if you did see the movie you are able to see the people who support the tale of horror and travel with them through the ghostly Manor.  I have read several King books that I would never consider reading again. ""The Shining"" is one I would read again a few years from now. ""It"" was my favorite and ""The Talisman"" is second.  These two I will continue to re-read over the coming years. So give The Shining a shot.  Bobby Brandt
"
"
  What can I say, I love Stephen King.  I'd seen some of the Stanley Kubrick film, and the book is very different.  I liked the book much better than the movie, which is how I've felt about almost every Stephen King movie.  I love the way King treats his characters, and I thought I would be annoyed to read a five year old's thoughts, but I wasn't.  I thought I would hate Jack, but I didn't.  I didn't exactly sympathize, but I never hated him.  I loved Wendy.  I loved Callahan.  As soon as I finished, I went and bought Dr. Sleep, which, I'm already loving.
"
"
  Another great story of terror by Stephen King.  I have read more than once . The movie was good but the book out shines it.
"
"
  When I saw that Mr King had written a sequel to ""The Shining"" (Doctor Sleep) I felt that I had to re-read ""The Shining"" so that his sequel would mean more to me.  I had read ""The Shining"" back in the '80's, when it first came out, and I remember getting goose bumps and could feel the hair on my neck stand up when I was at the moving topiary part of the novel.  I remember thinking that I was glad I read that portion during the day, because if it was dark, well, I'd probably be a gibbering idiot now.  Fast forward to today, and I didn't react as I did then, but that didn't diminish the fact that whatever else Mr King is, he tells a damn good and intriguing story.  Every King novel just grabs me, and I am lost in it until it's finished.  I highly recommend it.
"
"
  I'll be the first to admit I'm not a fan of horror. That being said with such a literary classic as The Shining is, I decided to take a peek. Filled with flaws characters and suspense Stephen King does a tremendous job bringing into this world he's created. You truly see the evolution into madness that Jack has throughout the story. It wasn't as based into horror as I thought it was, and actually tells a superb story. I'd gladly recommend this book as it was a worthwhile read.
"
"
  This book is outstanding!! Almost made me tear up a couple of times too. Stephen King has a way with words that both captivates, and terrifies you. I am now, and always will be a “Constant Reader” of the KING!!!
"
"
  I'm a grown man of 35 years. I remember as a young boy my brother made me watch this movie. Scared the s*** out of me. I've watched it several times since then and it still terrified me. But a then I was perussing kindle books and came across the sequel for the shining.  I love to read so I figured I would read the original book first.  The book is quite a bit different than the movie but twice as horrifying. I literally couldn't r read it before I went to bed if I wanted to sleep. so now on to the sequel. I can only hope it's half as scary. Damn you Steven King.
"
"
  I've been a Stephen King fan for years however I've never read any of the books that made King well known.  I only recently bought a Kindle so I decided now was as good of time as any to go back and read some of his earlier works and I started off with this one.  I, like most people have seen the Jack Nicholson version of the movie and liked it so of course going into the book I had preconceived notions in my head of the characters and how the book would play out.  After the first 1/4 I was able to stop envisioning the movie characters in the book and let them develop into who Stephen King originally envisioned them to be.I did not find this book scary; however most of what I read is this type of material.  Not much anymore gets my heart racing and makes me want to go around double checking the locks on all the doors at night.  That being said it is a great book and is so much better than the movie(s).
"
"
  Second time that I have read this and with more than twenty years between the two, she still holds water. I've seen the movie so many times that I forgot how good the book is.
"
"
  Can't believe I'm saying this publicly but I think the book might actually be better than the movie. And I love the movie. Ugh.
"
"
  I always wanted to read this book (and I still have some others that I need to read)This seemed like the last best chance for the Torrance family when they came tothe Overlook Hotel so that father, husband, and author Jack Torrance could serveas caretaker during the winter months when the hotel shuts down.  They seem tolike it here until strange things occur like moving hedge animals and ghosts fromthe past come to seek out the family.  Can they escape?  Must read!
"
"
  After watching the movie for the first time, I felt there were a lot of details missing. In order to fill in the gaps, I read the book. It’s amazig. I don’t know why I didn’t read it sooner! This is definitely a horror story, but it is much deeper than ghosts and gore.
"
"
  I had forgotten how good the book is since I've only read it once before & have been watching the movie more often. I mean, it's Stephen King. Of course it's a great story, but it's the way *he* tells it. I wanted to re-read this because I had just read Doctor Sleep (which is the story of ""Danny"" all grown up). Now I'm just glad I took the opp to re-read ""Shining"". Love King's way of telling a story & this is one of the best. (No matter how hard I tried though, I couldn't *not* see Jack Nicholson as the dad! LOL)
"
"
  This paperback reprint is so well done.  It’s almost like reading the hard cover book.I bought it as a birthday present and she loved it.
"
"
  Slightly cheaper than store price but all the quality, no damages, no wear. (With a bonus excerpt from the sequel)
"
"
  I vaguely remember seeing this movie years ago and couldn't remember the plot so this book was pretty much a new experience, free of expectations. Stephen King is obviously a pro as he has a way of controlling the pace at which you read and it keeps you flipping through this book. The antagonist is an alcoholic named Jack Daniel...poetic, and there's many more quirky allusions to stumble upon through out the book... and you get to peer into his mind as he goes insane. Even better, these characters are believable. I feel often you read or watch horror stories and find yourself frustrated with the decisions the characters make, but King's characters are believable, though hopefully not entirely relatable else you live a scary life.
"
"
  This is a classic, and deserves its fame. It's quite different from the movie; the book is more thrilling. The slow build of Jack's insanity is fascinating and chilling. For a book written in the 70's it's not too sexist, with Wendy being a strong character who largely owns her life. I highly recommend reading it, whether or not you've seen the movie.
"
"
  I'd probably give it 4.5 stars, if that were possible.It's tense, scary, well-structured and beautifully written. I've only got two qualm. Firstly, there are quite a few exposition-dumps which are a little bit too detailed, and go on for a while too long. But that problem is mitigated by the last half of the book, and I was never not interested, so I won't knock too much off for it. Secondly, the ending is a bit off-tone compared to the rest of the novel.
"
"
  This is such a good book. Way Better than the movie!! An absolute must read!! It keep me on the edge of my seat.
"
"
  Before buying Dr. Sleep, I decided to 're-read The Shining. Read it so long ago, almost all of it was unfamiliar. But because I read almost all his other books, I realized just how much of his special talent went into this one. Like another favorite, Under the Dome, there is breadth of comprehension few modern authors even approach in their work. Looking forward to see what life has thrown King's way in this sequel.
"
"
  This is way scarier than the popular movie. The star is not the Jack Nicholson-created nut case of the movie but rather the lead character is the ""innocent"" child on the tricycle. The heroic Mom of the movie is also overshadowed by the child's powerful role in the written tale. The book makes better sense than the movie -- even as some key scenes from the film are not part of the book.Having ""the shining"" is a mixed blessing for the child, but a real blessing for the reader.
"
"
  I was twelve the last time I read ""The Shining.""  The larger themes were somewhat evident to me then, whispers really, but reading it as an adult is a revelation.  There are so many ways this book is a reflection of its time while also being timeless, but for baby boomers and their children specifically, this story stands as an incredible metaphor for two generations of emotionally abandoned children.  Mr. King captures the minutiae of 20th century childhood better than anyone I've ever read, and this is true across his body of work.  I will echo what many have said here--read the book.  The movie is brilliant but flawed and largely without nuance, and it does not compare to the book itself.
"
"
  I read this book for the first time about 20 years ago and found it hard to follow. After reading the sequel, I decided to re-read it on my Kindle I received for Christmas this year. Stephen King is a brilliant writer and I had a very difficult time putting my Kindle down to do other things. The story is fast-paced and slowly terrifying. The characters are well developed and the horrors of the Overlook Hotel are spell-binding. Don't read this book if you're by yourself, in the dark, or just before bedtime!

  I absolutely loved this novel!It's exposition and climactic rise really make this book a must-read!I had unfortunately never read one of Stephen King's books, and now that I have I see what all of the rave is about.Definitely a book I'd recommend.
"
"
  I read this one when I was a kid and decided it deserved a second read well into adulthood. It failed to disappoint again, and I'll elaborate when more time permits. Overall, it isn't my favorite work of King's, but it's a stellar read.
"
"
  I absolutely love this book, it scared the crap out of me but is so well written that I couldn't put it down.
"
"
  What a great horror and suspense novel from beginning to the end. This will definitely keep you up at night.
"
"
  While I read other reviews stating you did not have to read this book before reading Doctor Sleep, I still wanted to because of all the positive reviews. I have to say I was not disappointed! This is the kind of book that keeps you on the seat of your pants the whole time wondering what is going to happen next and who will survive the Overlook Hotel in the end. At 650 pages, the book was longer than what I typically read, but I still finished over a weekend and can't wait to see what awaits in Doctor Sleep!

  I'm a Stephen King fan, period, and always enjoy his books. However, the problem to me with the Shining is two-fold. Its stretches very long, giving needless background information that doesn't really aid the story. That being said, it wraps up leaving alot frustratingly unexplained. For example, its hinted that Jack Torrance knows the manager of the hotel, yet we never really find out who it is ( sorry if I've said too much). Or, did the events of the past cause the hotel to become evil, or did the evil hotel cause the present and past events to happen? Maybe that was King's purpose, to leave us guessing. But it didn't sit well with me.That being said, its still a good read. Definitely read it, but dont be surprised if you find it doesn't make your top 10 of favorite books.

  I bought this as a gift for a friend and they absolutely love it. Thanks for a great book at such an affordable price and fast shipping. Love it

  Having devoured my share of early Stephen King novels in my teen years, I was delighted to learn he had revisited Danny Torrance's story recently. So, I downloaded Doctor Sleep, then realized I would enjoy it more if The Shining were reread first. I would much rather start the sequel with the taste of the original  on my lips.That's how I found myself reading the book again after some 30-odd years' interval.Age and a poor memory for remote details helped me enjoy revisiting the downward spiral of Jack Torrance and the demon-infused Overlook Hotel. It was like visiting with family members I hadn't seen in decades.My own experiences with alcoholism and abstinence and sobriety helped me to understand Jack's mindset in a way a teenage me (Vanessa) could never have anticipated. Bravo. Mr. King brilliantly depicted the simmering resentments of untreated alcoholism and toxic shame & blaming that characterize the inner life of an alcoholic.Well done. I appreciate this story and the deft hand that crafted it more now than I had 30+ years ago.Vanessa (not Howard, who bought me my kindle) Walker

  Nothing like the movie at all so don't worry about the story being ruined. This was one of the best books I've ever read, King's writing is so relevant and disturbing and terrifying even after all these years. I couldn't put this book down, and when I was done I immediately bought the sequel (Dr. Sleep, which was also amazing).
"
"
  This is only the second Stephen King book I've read (the first one being It), but overall really good book! the only reason I give it 4 stars is because I liked It better than The Shining. Looking forward to reading Doctor Sleep next!
"
"
  I have not read horror genre in a long time. Stephen King does not disappoint with this classic. The whole time I was on edge. While I was scared out of my mind about the creatures that haunted the hotel, the thing that scared me most was Jack. This could be any man or woman. Suffering from addiction, failure and being head of the household. I would highly recommend this book.
"
"
  As a fan of Stephen King, albeit an Inconstant Reader, I don't know how I avoided The Shining for so long. Maybe I didn't want to spoil my memory of Kubrick's movie. I finally decided to read it before I read Doctor Sleep (a decision made easier by a timely sale on Amazon) and I was surprised to find that the book is nothing like the movie, or at least it's concerned about something completely different. The Shining is ultimately a very sad story of the fall of a good man, and it makes the sequel more poignant.
"
"
  I'd read a lot of King.I loved the movie and held off reading the book for years.It certainly did NOT spoil the reading of this book. Trust me, there is nothing you've seen in the movie that will spoil this book.Completely different.The characters are different, motives, actions, dialog, everything.One thing the movie actually helps with is  allowing you to picture a grand hotel like the Overlook as the story unfolds.
"
"
  A classic that everyone should read at least once! It's different than the movie so you won't be bored!
"
"
  I last read this when I was in high school, right after this came out. I enjoyed it tremendously once again. The problem I had reading it this time was that I could SOOOOOOO see Jack Nicholson playing the part of Jack in the book - I was actually hearing his voice while reading the lines. I haven't seen the other movie version yet, although I now have it to watch, and intend to do so in the next few days. Even with that, however, it was a terrific book. I needed a refresher, so now I can read Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  If you can only read three books by Stephen King, my recomendation would be ""The Shining,"" ""11/22/63."" and ""Christine.""King is the master of character development,  giving his readers a real feel for and connection with the characters.  If you saw the movie ""The Shining"" and think you know the story, think again. The movie is great, the book is way better. Or to quote a ""down Mainer,"" this book is ""wicked good.""It is helpful to read before ""Dr Sleep"" but not a prerequisite.
"
"
  I saw the flick years ago when it hit the theatres. This has a lot more detail and scenes I don't recall from the movie. I will say that I think the one distractor I observed is the story actually ended before the book did. One line was missing that I recall from the move which set the entire audience laughing...it was when the character Jack, played by Jack Nicholson broke through the door where Wife Wendy was hiding...his head sticking through with a maniacal grin Jack says; Here's Johnny!"" Sadly, it wasn't in the book.
"
"
  Even if you did not enjoy the movie, you will love this book.  It is an absorbing revelation of a self-centered man's gradual descent into madness, an ineffectual woman who avoids the acceptance of harsh reality until it is too late, and an innocent, but brave child who tries to help the parents he loves & hold his disintegrating family together,  As with all paranormal fiction, the reader must be willing to suspend disbelief to fully enjoy the story, but Stephen King weaves a masterful tale of ghosts, evil,deceit, love, and resourcefulness.
"
"
  I saw the movie 100 years ago and LOVED it. 'Fell in love with Jack Nicholson's talent. the story line all of it. But I never read the book....until now. WOW! No wonder they made a movie out of it. And even better, I am on page 124 reading the sequel, Doctor Sleep. If you choose to read The Shinning, plan on the sequel right after it. Stephen King picks right up where The Shinning lets off so the continuation really works. I am now a Stephen King FAN and plan on reading Joyland next!!!!
"
"
  It's not the same as the one in the picture, but I don't care. Relatively small book, Great to finally have this masterpiece.
"
"
  Stephen King has some great books I love: The Shining, Carrie, Duma Key, Under the Dome, Doctor Sleep. I love the point of view switching that goes on in The Shining, switching from Jack to Danny to the Mother. You get to see the madness from all points of view. It's not like the movie, really, although the plot is similar. The symbolism in the book is more specific to the evil within the hotel itself and how it lures Jack further into madness. The movie was good too, but in a different way. One of my all-time favorite King books.
"
"
  Enjoyed reading this book, very different from Hollywood's  version of it. Only thing I didn't care for were the hedge animals that came to life. For me, they just didn't fit in with the story and seemed like filler.
"
"
  Solid writing by King. Was on my list of Summer reads and saw an opportunity to cross it off my list. Diverted from the film. But worth the read.
"
"
  It took a while to pick up but it was an ok book. Something to read in between or during Halloween
"
"
  This was an excellent read! Despite seeing the movie before reading the book, reading it was a pleasure. Suspense was on every page and each chapter brought another enthralling plot point. I highly recommend this book!
"
"
  I wish I had read this years ago. I still have unanswered questions, am very tempted to hit up king on Twitter now lol. On to doctor sleep!
"
"
  Stephen King enabled me to understand the mind of a man who struggled to contain the anger within himself but then slid steadily from closeness with his wife towards suspicion of her and then onto much worse. I felt it was tragic that he was so much a victim of the forces of evil. As usual with Stephen King, there is little ambiguity in any of the characters or in the nature of evil. Evil is real and very destructive. You know what you are up against. It was a satisfying read as always.
"
"
  This book was one of the best novels I've read until it got to the climax. Up until the point - heavily foreshadowed - when Jack Torrance goes on a homicidal rampage, it was an outstanding portrait of male violence, depression and shame. Shame, most of all. Stephen King hit the nail on the head with this one. In the early stages of the novel the telepathic son, Danny, confides that he has read the word ""DIVORCE"" in his parents' minds. This is a result of Jack breaking the boy's arm in a drunken brain snap; his mother is horrified. But behind that word ""DIVORCE"", in his father's mind lurks another word: ""SUICIDE"". This was the point where I became hooked. And from what I've read about domestic violence, the male aggressor usually does mean it when he promises that he'll be destroyed if his partner leaves him. Shame, horrible self-pity, self-hatred. This all made so much sense.As the novel goes on you get incident after incident of Jack getting angry and snapping at his wife. Viciously angry (the only part that Jack Nicholson really does well in the movie, imo). She annoys him, she unwittingly pokes his sore spots, and he sees red. It's realistic and you feel the potential for the final eruption into murder building beautifully.But then King crashes. Badly. It's like he loses interest or got tired writing it. Or, maybe, he didn't want to say too much because his wife and children would read the final draft??? It's such a disappointment, because he'd set it all up so well. But the final descent into homicidal madness simply makes no sense. I was bored by the last two hundred pages or so. The ghosts made him do it? Please. We deserved more than that, Mr King!No, I can't bee too ungrateful. It was a novel well worth the read for that excellent lead-up. Definitely scared me in parts too.
"
"
  I reread this because I recently bought Dr Sleep. I wanted to refresh my memory of The Shining in BOOK form as there are significant differences in the Movie and the book. I have read JUST ABOUT everything my favorite writer has ever published (sometimes more than 2 or 3 times) with the exception of some of the earlier short stories in the old Sci-fi mags since I can't get ALL of those! I truly love every King book and story I have ever read. I Pray that Mr King has a long and healthy life and keeps the stories coming our way<3
"
"
  I always enjoyed the movie so I thought it was time to read the book. I can tell you the book is much better. I like the character detail. I never realized all the dynamics of their relationships until I read the book. The behind the scenes detail makes the stay at the hotel make more sense. Highly recommend for anyone that is a fan of Stephen King's work.
"
"
  Fantastic read!  I had seen the movie so I knew (or thought I knew) a lot that was going to happen.  The book was far better with great character and plot development. As much as I was a Kubrick fan, I now question him as the best director choice, missing a lot of opportunity to make it scary. It was my first Stephen King book and now I'm on to Dr Sleep.  Highly recommended.
"
"
  Despite the movie, directed by Stanley Kubrick being excellent, the book is even better.
"
"
  I loved the book. I did not read it years ago but recently it was given to me by my grandson and it was great.
"
"
  In my opinion, this is one of the best king stories i have ever read! Its a classic, but still absolutely terrifying.
"
"
  The book builds slowly and then hits a break neck pace for a strong finish.  Great read from Stephen King.
"
"
  The details the author gets into with the characters including the hotel. Every page was an escalation of sorts into the three next chapter of this exquisite story. This has made me love this author's writing even more. He's brilliant. This book solidified his status as a platinum author long before i was thought about. Must read!
"
"
  I have watched the movie many times, and loved it, but I thought that I should read the book just in case there was some details missing from the movie, and then I could begin reading the squeal. The book is so much more than the movie. Characters have more depth and are more likable. The best thing is that the book is so much better than the movie. Such a satisfying read. I loved it!
"
"
  Quintessential Stephen King.  There is so much more story than appears on the movie.
"
"
  Better than the movie, with a more satisfying ending. But not as gripping as I had hoped. Maybe if I hadn’t seen the movie several times it wold have been more compelling.
"
"
  Now I understand why Stephen King was angry at Stanley Kubrick movie he really missed the point of the book.  Either way a must read.
"
"
  After watching the classic movie I knew I needed to read the book and see how it REALLY went down at the Overlook. I must say it was so much more thrilling and full of depth. I hated being there, with Jack, as the hotel took over. He held on as long as he could but the forces at work were far too strong. I really enjoyed reading The Shining. It dragged sometimes and Kings imagination is...something else. Sometimes too far out there. Or not far enough? Either way I will definitely be reading Doctor Sleep soon.
"
"
  The level of detail is sooooo good. The book was much better than the movie. Will do a more detailed review in a few days.
"
"
  Even though I am not a fan of the horror genre I decided to read the book after having watched the movie. King is a master story teller. The movie did not do justice to the book.
"
"
  I cannot imagine how the movie and the book of The Shining share the same name. They are so unrelated. King is a capable storyteller. Kubrick creates images and his work is dated, hardly similar enough to even use King's name..King is so intense, immediate, and intelligent.  I am not one who likes violence or vulgarity but they are situational  plausible.  There is no excuse for the movie when King created such a great story.
"
"
  I watched her read the book in about 1 week. She said that the book is way better than the movie. After she read the book we watched the movie.
"
"
  King's classic. Great read, where each chapter makes you want to read the next. Scary, suspenseful, and timeless
"
"
  I would definitely recommend this book. King knows how to spark your imagination. If you want to wonder if your surroundings are coming to life with the spirits of the past this is a book for you.
"
"
  A fantastic horror story best read in tandem with Kubrick's 1980 screen  interpretation. Because the book fleshed out the character's background and therefore added historical depth to the Overlook hotel saddled with decades scandals revolving round people who have stayed at the hotel. Still the film was excellent because it filled our retinas with the beautiful Espen Colorado, and the chilling blood bath sloshing elevators and the rotting woman in the tub. But most of all, the diabolical image of Jack Nicholson playing the diabolical Jack character. This is not a comparison of film or book or a question of which was better. Both film and book can stand on their own as monumental classics. But when you put them together, they complement each other and the story becomes an unforgettable intelligent horror story.
"
"
  The book is a bit different from the Stanley Kubrick's movie. This book provides many details that one might not grasp by watching the movie. The timelessness of the Overlook hotel is one of them. It is depicted in the book as living entity that contains human emotions from all times, and they are superimposed in space. It also shows that Overlook was actually after Danny because he was the Shining and Jack Torrance was an instrument to achieve the diabolical objective. This is simply Stephen King at his best.
"
"
  Awesome awesome awesome!!! If you haven’t read this book, do so. And if your only exposure to “the shining” is Stanley Kubrick’s film the original story is much darker and scarier. Remember, “stay out of room 217, you ain’t got no business going in there anyway...”
"
"
  The book is very interesting to read. I couldn't stop until finished reading. It is much more interesting then movie.
"
"
  Saw the movie and had to read the book.  Much more in the book as expected but there were variations in the plot line.  Especially the ending.  R Engblom
"
"
  Have been a fan since The Stand. Love the fact that Mr. King was a teacher of English like myself and is, still to this day, demonstrating the skill of an eloquent story-teller to students whose imaginations have been made limited due to the phone they hold constantly in their hands. Put the phones down and imagine Life beyond them!Cindi Sirois Collins
"
"
  The classic shining by Steven King.  Just as scary as the first time I read it.
"
"
  This is such a great classic!  If you liked the movie this is FAR better!!  Stephen king is a genius at putting you inside the story and making you feel like you are there
"
"
  I enjoyed this book. I have seen the movie a few times, but hadn't ever read it. There are enough differences to make it fresh. The audible narrator did a great job with it too.
"
"
  This was sent as a present for my grandson - we had both seen the famous movie.
"
"
  So disappointed.. the book I received was NOT the one that it’s advertised. No dust cover, not first edition, no autographs.Not the one that was on the advertised pictures.This totally will be returned.
"
"
  After reading Misery I figured I'd follow up with The Shining. While Misery was bloody and definitely creepy, this takes that to a whole new level. I had to put this book down a few times while reading it at night and come back to it later. It's by far the scariest book I've read. Jack descending into madness and the ominous, claustrophobic, alive feeling of the Overlook hotel throughout the story is captivating and horrifying. What I think makes this so good too is I feel like I could start re-reading it right now and still be terrified.
"
"
  While the movie was spectacular, the book was, as is often the case, even better. The ending was especially an improvement over the movie version as well as much of Jack's and Danny's interactions with the Overlook.
"
"
  After seeing Stephen King on CBS Sunday morning a while back, reading this book was on my to do list. King expressed that yes he liked Kubrick as a director but hated what his vision was with the story. Months later I finally bought a kindle and The Shining was the first book I read.I am amazed with the story, and even though these are just words I am seeing...it's visually stunning. I found myself biting my lip hard reading it with anxieties for Danny and I was sad for Jack most of all.I can't wait to dive into Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  This is one of the scariest books I've ever read by Stephen King.  The plot keeps you hooked from the beginning to end.  Also makes you think twice about the holiday in the mountains you may have been planning!
"
"
  There's not really anything I can say about this book that hasn't already been said. It's scary, suspenseful, extremely well written, and just an overall great book to read. I'd recommend this book to anyone who asked. I'm probably biased because Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, but it's still an awesome story whether you're just now picking it up, or you're a Constant Reader like me. It's one of Mr. Kings best stories, so pick it up.
"
"
  We know that Stephen King is the master of horror stories, I love them all.
"
"
  I bought this to reread as it'd been years. The copy was fine & I loved the book itself.
"
"
  My niece had to read this over the summer for school, and was terrified - she does not like scary things.  I thought....have I ever read The Shining?  Thought I read all of SK novels 30 or 35 years ago....so, picked it up and was instantly hooked. Certainly one of his best!  And no, I hadn't read it....maybe the length intimidated me in my younger days?  Anyway, outstanding.
"
"
  I have never re-read a book but I'm very glad I did, such a amazing story that's easy to forget when you watch the movie.
"
"
  This novel is one that needs little to no introduction. Brilliantly written with a timeless legacy, it is a beautiful journey into the macabre and the tragic. A must have not only for the horror enthusiast, but for anyone who enjoys a good story.
"
"
  I have been a Stephen King fan as long as I can remember. I own his books in hardback, paperback, audio and Kindle format. This story is one of his best and it is creepy and scary. The story in the book for me was better than the movie but both are 5 stars. I will not do any spoilers as there are so many good reviews.  You should know that this is a book worth getting.If you are a King fan then this book has to be in the top 5 or 10 of his best. I enjoyed reading it.
"
"
  It’s my first Stephen King book. At first I thought it would be very scary, but it turned out negative. It wasn’t very scary especially in the first twenty or so chapters. In general it’s a good read but not to my expectations. Maybe it’s not the kind of books that will interest me.
"
"
  Well, I had seen the Movie, and then I bought and read Doctor Sleep, the follow-on to the Shinning, and found out it was based on the book, and not the movie.  So, I had to buy the book and read it to understand the references in Doctor Sleep. Don't get me wrong; you can read it without reading The Shinning, but you will get more out of it if you read The Shinning first.  I highly recommend both. Stephen King at his best.
"
"
  The scenes with jack losing his mind are absolutely horrifying,  and I Love king writes Jack's internal struggle with the hotel
"
"
  This book is amazing, this is definety the best book from Stephen King. The only problem I have, it would be the delivery, the book arrived with some scratches but it does not affect the content,
"
"
  I picked this up because of the new book doctor sleep. I can't say whether it was my first time reading this or not because I've read so much of his books and he's been a part of my life for more than two decades. Amazing detail as king is known for never did I find myself bored. Brilliant creativity, the darkness has its hold on kings creative side. I'm always at awe and always jealous....true talent lies within the pages of this story. Masterful skill with each character. Loved it.
"
"
  This is my top five of stephen king books i ever read.  I've read it before and will read it again.  The only reason i read it again was so i can read doctor sleep.  I am glad the king wrote it and i will always be a fan. 5 overlook out of 5
"
"
  One of his earliest as well as one of his best! Stephen King can't be beat especially in the earlier years. This will have you sleeping with a light on and avoiding old hotels. Especially those in the mountains!
"
"
  I watched the movie many years ago and loved it. After learning that the novel is different, I decided to read it in preparation for Dr. Sleep. King will take you in a journey of mixed human feelings represented in the ""good and bad"" Jack Torrence. A man who loves his family so much but was raised by an alcoholic so sooner or later was going to pick after his father. Also, cabin fever + demons + a sense of underachievement don't mix well. Just read it!
"
"
  I was not expecting the book to be as good as it was.  It’s a very easy read that isn’t fulled with mundane information and is so much better than the movie!
"
"
  I saw the movie when I was just 13 years old and have watched it at least 50 more times since. Now at age 52, I have finally read the book. I was enthralled from the very beginning to learn about these characters. The back stories and motivations are now clear to me, and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride King took me on. Loved it!
"
"
  Doctor Sleep is on my list of books I'd like to read. I watched The Shining many years ago as a kid, but I wanted to read the book before I read the sequel. I didn't expect to be scared, but I was. I had some troubling dreams while reading this book. It's classic King and I enjoyed it.
"
"
  While this is the first Stephen King book I have read, I find his writing to be full of suspense that never lets you go until the last page. The Shining keeps you on the edge of your seat as a mix of horror, suspense, and action in the supernatural setting of the Overlook Hotel. It is a must read.
"
"
  I've seen the movie too many times to count since my you into adulthood. Book shared some common themes and then some completely different. Did explain one scene in the movie that I never understood the meaning. Great book! On to the next, what shall it be Mr. King?
"
"
  At the point in King's career when he wrote The Shining, my opinion was that he was a better storyteller than a writer. I preferred 'Salem's Lot to The Shining because it was far less subtle than his other books in building to the horror. It also owes a lot to Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House and Henry James' The Turn of the Screw (and are excellent books). I also couldn't help but notice that Richard Matheson published his haunted house tale, Hell House, the same year (which was far more derivative than The Shining).Danny is an excellent character and King does a good job of putting himself back into childhood and lends authenticity to the character. Jack and Wendy did not deserve such a bright and loving child (but few parents would). Danny is the glue that held them together and, with Dick Hallorann, saves himself and Wendy.Dick Hallorann is a good protector and the integrity and love he shows Danny provides hope for the young protagonist. He serves as Danny's mentor and protector.I have seen some comments about Wendy's strength but she has little self esteem and depends on Jack's approval for much of her self image. Her backstory provides insight to her feelings about herself and her lack of confidence. While she wants to provide for and protect Danny, she lacks the sense of self to do so and it is Danny's strength that saves her. Her love for her son is what saves her and does provide Danny with his ability to rise to the challenges at the Overlook.Jack is a charming alcoholic without the ability to accept responsibility for his poor choices and lack of insight to see he is repeating his father's pattern of a drunken abuser. Along with his alcoholism, Jack also has some real issues with anger. While being intelligent and talent, he seems to try and get by on his charm. It is easy to see how he would be the easiest character for the evil forces to manipulate. His egocentric personality and vanity combined with his recent failures stemming from his own poor judgement make him the character with the psychic target on his back.It is a decent tale and none of the films of it have done it justice. Kubrick's was too cerebral and the other was too sanitized.
"
"
  Stephan King out did himself with this book. With the level of description in this book it’s unbelievable.
"
"
  Stephen King at his best.  His character development is amazing and they way he weaves his story so that everything comes together in the end is what he does best.  You never know what is going to happen next and as scary as it is, you just have to keep reading. His descriptions are so good that you can ""see"" everything you are reading about.  The book is so much better than the movie because it has lots of details.  Even though you may have seen the movie, you need to read the book to learn more about each character.
"
"
  The story was great but the size of the book and the print I did not care for very bulky and the print very small.
"
"
  The setting, the pacing and the outcome.  Everything was perfect. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a long read that will take them away from reality
"
"
  I've read a few books by Stephen King before, even when he was under the pseudonym of ""Richard Bachman."" Certainly, I enjoyed what I read, but I would have to say that The Shining stood out among them. I've seen Kubrick's film adaptation, so I had an idea of what I was getting into. However, I did not think I would find the book far more compelling than the movie. The characters have a fascinating amount of depth and I found myself, naturally, cheering for them when things began to fall apart. In conclusion, The Shining is a haunting and impressive book that deserves the accolades it is given.
"
"
  I'm a long time King fan and have read many of his books. Somehow, I never got around to reading The Shining until now and only did because I'm anxious to read Doc Sleep. I have to say, it's my new favorite!  The characters are so well defined and the creepy factor is at an all time high. I used whisper-sync and part time listened on audible when in the car. There were times I wanted to pull over and double check the back seat! Late night reading in bed led to, being ultra sensitive to every creak or sound during the night.This is classic King where you get the chills from imagining the horror and fright, and not all the extra gore and grotesque that some of his other works have now.  There's plenty of gross but the fright factor outweighs it.  The character development is outstanding. King does his normal brilliant job of painting a vivid picture in the readers mind. One that stays with you long after you've closed the  book for the night.
"
"
  Fell in love with this book, after only having seen the movie.  I can see why King was not exactly pleased with the cinematic recreation of his work.  They seem like two different stories.  Really, really loved the psychological views, seeing in Jack, Danny, and his wife's head.  Seeing the slow degradation of Jack's mind and thought-process, and his struggle with his temper and his alcoholic tendencies as the winter wore on was great.  Loved hearing Danny's side of the story, as well as the other multiple viewpoints to create a chilling haunted story that really dealt with evil and sanity.5/5 would read again

  This book is very scary as to be expected but much deeper than the movie.  This is a classic Stephen King horror and will keep you up at night.

  The book came fast and came brand new love reading Stephen King
"
"
  I read this long ago and I decided to read it again prior to reading Stephen King's new novel Doctor Sleep.  The Shining is Stephen's best work in my opinion.  The story contains great character development and it keeps the reader flipping pages.  I am almost done and I will be sorry to see this story end.  Get a copy of this for your Kindle or get a book for your hands.  It will grab a hold of your mind and not let go until the last page.  Enjoy.

  I know it sounds dramatic, but a friend brought this book to me years ago. She knew I never read books. A few that I needed to read but I was 25 years old and never read fore pleasure. She said she guaranteed I would like this. I loved it and the way Stephen King writes. It started me on a new direction in my life. I now read every day and enjoy all kinds of books. I picked this up and read it again just to see if I still liked it. I surely did.
"
"
  Easily one of the best books ever written. It's nothing like the movie, which is brilliant in it's own way. The book is about a broken family trying to fix their bond, and a possessed hotel trying to .... nvm. Just read the book. Be prepared that it's nothing like the movie. It's much better.
"
"
  Please read this book! It’s so good & so different from the movie. I’m writing an essay on it for college. Never thought I would get this into King!!
"
"
  Loved this book. I have only read a few Stephen King books,though I do enjoy his writing. For some reason,I pre-ordered Dr. Sleep before realizing it was a sequel. So I decided I needed to read this one first. So glad I did. It was so much richer in character development than the movie was. I thoroughly enjoyed every page. The only reason I am not giving this five stars is because I reserve that highest rating for very special ones. The Shining is very close to that, though.
"
"
  This was my first venture into a world that Stephen King has crafted, and I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed. The themes are explored with such painstaking detail and makes you truly feel like you are there with the characters. I would say this is a great starting point if you are looking into reading King. Off to read It!

  Gave to my daughter as a gift . She was excited to get it

  What's more creepy than being trapped in an old hotel during a winter blizzard? Being trapped in an old creepy hotel during a winter storm that has evil inside. Young Danny Torrance is not like other little boys, he can feel something wrong in the old hotel. His father, Jack, desperate for a job agreed to maintain the hotel during the winter but does he know the consequences?A wonderful, scary winter read that takes cabin fever to an all new meaning.
"
"
  I liked all of the novel and it told a story about how alcoholism can ruin a man and his family but was set in an awesome location in a creepy hotel in the high country of Colorado  and how being shut in for the winter can affect people even when they love each other and lead to their destruction.
"
"
  Great book, makes the movie not so scary, with a lot of holes.  The mother is not some scream machine in the book.  If there was ever a remake for a movie, this would be it.
"
"
  As always, the book is so much better than the movie. Don't watch the movie first as you'll know what's coming. After reading the book, I watched the movie and was very disappointed by the way many many subplots were left out and things were changed to make the movie producers plot easier to portray with real actors. I wanted to read this book before reading Stephen King's latest book called Doctor Sleep. I know it will be as great as the Shining.
"
"
  I had to re-buy this on kindle because I wanted to read the sequel. You think just because you watched the movie again that you know what's going on? You don't!!! Re-read it! The movie doesn't do the novel justice! There is so much more, especially if you want to read ""Dr. Sleep."" There is a lot to go back to, a ton of relevant information to the sequel that you won't even comprehend from just watching the movie. I hadn't read ""The Shining"" in over twenty years. I'm so glad I got it again!
"
"
  I love reading Stephen King books and one of the reasons why is that most people just write him off as a horror writer, but those that read his works should know that it if you had to put him in just one genre it would probably be more psychological. This especially rings true to me after reading ""The Shining"" which tells the story of Jack Torrance's struggle with remaining in control of his own actions and keeping his family safe from other things along with himself. Jack has made mistakes in the past and hurt his family do to his drinking but is really trying to start new but dealing with the struggles of trying not to drink, keeping his anger in check, doing what is best for his family. Jack's wife Wendy is trying to keep her son safe and help her husband, her biggest struggle is that she tries to trust Jack but at some points finds herself hating him. Jack's son Danny is young but has a very strong power that he later learns from the caretaker to refer to as a shine, gives him premonitions of things to come as well as some telepathy. Danny knows to much for his own good and understands that something is wrong with the hotel the Overlook but does not know how to explain it to his parents. Danny tries to save his dad and mom but does not know what to do and if his premonitions will even come true. The characters are really deep and full of their own problems and it is interesting to see the inner workings of each and really connect to them.
"
"
  I doubt my review could add anything g that has not been said before. This is an excellent written book that will stay in your mind after you finish it. I watched the movie first, so I had set images of what the characters looked like in my head, although King describes them differently. That was the only thing that somehow bothered me. The preconceptions I had about it. Nevertheless, as it usually is, the book is by far better than the movie.
"
"
  Did Torrance have a tendency toward insanity and violence before the Overlook or was the hotel really a demonic entity controlling Jack? The Shining is the original psychological bender as the reader may discover a bit of himself or herself in the characters developed by Stephen King in these pages. Fair warning: do NOT read at night...
"
"
  Stephen King has been one of my favorite authors ever since I read IT, but this book blew me away all over again. I never cease to be amazed by the depth of his characters and his clever use of language. And this along with his amazing use of foreshadowing and story telling. This is one of the scarier King books I have read. I highly recommend.
"
"
  Nice paperback copy of a classic!  My child loves it!
"
"
  So much better than the movie. On a Steven king kick!
"
"
  I 've seen this movie several times and it still makes me sit on the edge of my seat . And now that I've just finished the book , it had me from the beginning I couldn't put it down I had to find out what was waiting for me page after page . Thanks Mr King for another masterpiece.
"
"
  The Shining is hands down one of my favorite SK books.  It always gave me goosebumps when I was younger, and it still does today.  It's a great intro to SK book, just make sure to read it with the lights on ;)
"
"
  Although no surprise, the book always outshines the movie adaption. This is the case with The Shining. Really no review I could write could express or even provide more insights to what has already been written. Stephen King is the man and The Shining really highlights what an outstanding writer he is. Brilliant, simply brilliant!
"
"
  I read this novel many years ago, I have the paperback and it is so dogeared from reading it many times.  I always find things I have missed.  Stephen King does not disappoint his readers.  I am glad to have it on my kindle now.  I have been downloading many of my paperbacks  onto my kindle.  I enjoy rereading them.  This story will have you hooked from the beginning.  The movie is great but the book puts you right there at the ""Overlook"".  Happy Reading!
"
"
  Early King that still holds up for the most part.  Jack Nicholson Was perfect casting for the part but book, as always, so much better than the movie.
"
"
  Love, love, love this book!  The narrator was fabulous!  I've read the paper copy, saw both movies (hated the original but loved the remake) and now the audio version in preparation for the sequel and I believe the audio book version is my favorite!
"
"
  The book was in very good condition when I received it. As for the book itself, it is a very spectacular read and very different from the movie adaptations. If you are a lover of Stephen King films and wish to get into his book adaptations, I have highly recommend starting with The Shining!
"
"
  Absolutely loved every page. Mr. King wrote a master piece of page turning thrill. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to take a scary adventure with masterfully written characters.
"
"
  Stephen King should have been angry at the way the movie presented this book. I devoured The Shining and was surprised by how much the movie missed in telling this story. His writing is steady, even and the characters are even more vivid on the pages. Suspenseful, but well paced. Love this book.
"
"
  I've never read the book before, only seen the Stanley Kubrick adaption. The book goes so much deeper than I realized. And once Jack fell deeper into the clutches of the Overlook Hotel, I couldn't put the book down! Another one of his must reads!!
"
"
  This is the book that made me a Stephen King affezionato.  Very mysterious, very original plot content, terrific characters.  The first time I read it, when it was first published, it scared the bejesus out of me.  I had nightmares about those moving hedge carvings.I just reread it in preparation for reading DR. SLEEP, with just as much enjoyment but with no nightmares, thank goodness.
"
"
  The Shining has been one of my favorite movies for as far back as I can remember, and yet somehow I made it this far without ever reading it. Well, it was finally time to change that.This story about the Torrance family and the haunted Overlook Hotel where they spend a secluded winter is truly chilling. As always, King’s character development is what stands out and makes it so successful.Jack, the patriarch of the family, is by far the strongest and most well-developed character. He’s an abusive alcoholic whose anger issues have recently cost him his prestigious teaching job, leaving him no choice but to take a gig as the winter caretaker of a secluded resort in the Colorado mountains. As the hotel begins to takes hold of him, it’s hard to discern if it’s just Jack’s own inner demons or something much more malevolent.This, to me, is the most interesting aspect of the book. I loved seeing how the hotel manipulated Jack by preying on his insecurities. And when his wife, Wendy, begins to fear him, it’s Jack-her-husband, not Jack-the-possessed, whom she initially fears—and we can’t really blame her.The paranoia and dread mount quickly, encompassing Jack, Wendy and their son Danny—gifted with a sixth sense that’s both a blessing and a curse—in a sinister plot to trap them in the hotel forever.This was a powerful, creepy read that kept me captivated, though I was hoping for a bit more cohesion to the sinister backstory. Also worth noting: once you’ve seen the movie, it’s impossible to picture anyone but Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance. This is one of the rare instances (yes, I’m going there!) where I liked the movie more than the book. I mean…Nicholson, Kubrick? Come on!
"
"
  I must say that I enjoyed this novel from the first page until the last. The scary parts were intense, gripping, and totally spine-tingling. I lapped them all up like a thirsty dog on a hot summer day. But what I really love about this book is the bond between father and son. I lost my dad when I was a young child and I could relate to the unquestioning and unwavering love for one's parent. This love will prevail over any adversary or darkness; and, in this superb novel, it was Danny's (and Jack's)  best weapon against the Overlook. I cried during the confrontation between father (who wasn't quite himself at this point) and son during the climax. It made me think of the sacrifices my own dad had made for me and my family. This novel by Stephen King is one of my all-time favorites!
"
"
  Who needs Jack N.s ""Hereeere's Johnnny""!!! this book is the real deal behind the Overlook Hotel. The psychic reality of the situation is wonderfully explained by Stephen, who I understand had alot of problems with the movie. This book is tough to put down, and even when you know there'll be a rescue, you still hang on with doubt. It is a true thriller.
"
"
  The first time I read the shining I was an awestruck teenager, now reading it for the third time I'm delighted to still be impressed. Truly one of King's best. This time through the story of Jack Torrance's struggle with alcohol & anger captivated me almost more than the Overlook's growing hold over him ... All the more frightening for being so close to home. Now, off to read Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  For those who have just seen the movie you should read the book. Really very different and the book is much better. I came back to reread it after reading Dr Sleep and I am glad I did
"
"
  KUBRICK FOCUSED MORE ON THE SLOWLY-BUILDING INSANITY WITHIN JACK TORRANCE (THE FATHER), IMPLYING HIS SOLITUDE MADE HIM THE MORE VULNERABLE TO THE GHOSTS' INFLUENCE, WHEREAS THE BOOK EXPLAINS THE HOTEL ITSELF WAS A LIVING EVIL ENTITY AND WANTED DANNY'S GIFT (THE SON) AT ANY COST. THAT WAS A RADICAL DEPARTURE, BUT I GUESS MOVIES HAVE TO ABRIDGE EVERYTHING TO FIT A 2-HOUR FORMAT.
"
"
  Anyone who loves Stephen King (and who doesn't) will love this book. I have always claimed Stanley Kubrick's version my favorite film of all time. After reading, you realize there is so much depth and much more substances than shown in the film. I wanted to attend Torrance's spiral into madness more and more after every page.
"
"
  When I saw that Doctor Sleep was coming out, I knew I wanted to read this book to get the full background. Stephen King is my favorite author, and this book was amazing. I couldn't put it down, even when it got pretty scary. I could easily visualize everything that was happening, to the point where I was disappointed in the film (it wasn't like I pictured!). Definitely recommend to any SK fan.
"
"
  I'm not a huge horror fan, but my mom was raving about Dr. Sleep. I figured that I better start at the beginning. I might be a sissy but I thought his writing was really scary. It kept me on my toes and was an interesting and entertaining read
"
"
  Loved it! Great book and Stephen ki g has always been a favorite of mine.
"
"
  This is really not the same as the movie in so many ways and it's the first time I've read the book. There's a lot more psychology involved in the book for one. It's almost like every last character has personal inner demons of which little bits and pieces of those conflicts get divulged every once in a while. In many ways I think this was the authors best.
"
"
  Absolutely loved this book, couldn't put it down. It has all of the essential elements for a good horror. The isolation, misdirection, and a red herring.I had read this back in high school and just recently picked up Dr. Sleep book so a re-read was needed. Forgot how good of a book this is.
"
"
  Don't watch the Kubrick movie just yet - read the book and forget there is any connection between them. The book is so much richer, interesting... I believe the movie leaves out the real relationship between Jack Torrance and the Hotel. You won't be disappointed by reading the book, whereas I cannot assure the same thing if you watch the movie. Tip: if you watch the movie, be sure to watch AFTER the awesome documentary ROOM 237. You won't believe what's really happening in the movie!!
"
"
  Thank you, Stephen King, you gave me a sleepless night. Also thank you because I payed attention to my house usually normal noises. Finally, thank you Stephen King because the noises and yelling a drunk neighbor was doing when he arrived home at 4am almost made me pee my pants.
"
"
  Great book. Love having it on my Kindle instantly.
"
"
  I still love the way Stephen King writes. I thought he uses language well. Unfortunately there's the kid. He just doesn't do that great with kid dialogue. I did not buy that Danny was five. His height and dialogue changes frequently. I thought he should've been at least eight.This one wasn't scary either. But I was on the edge of my seat throughout the climax. I'll check out the sequel.
"
"
  It's a Stephen King classic. So much better than the movie!  What more can I say? It's no coincidence that his name is King!
"
"
  It has been many years since I've read this book, but with it being October, I wanted to read a creepy, Halloweenish kind of book. Once again I am reminded of what an amazing author Stephen King is! Wow! I had forgotten so many little things in this book, and I am so glad I re-read it. Now that I have Danny fresh in my mind, I can start Doctor Sleep.Wahoo! Keep them coming Mr. King.
"
"
  Excellent.  So much better than the movie.  Not very many books give me the heebie-jeebies.  This one did in spades.
"
"
  So much better than the movieI think so much so that I wished I had never seen the movie
"
"
  One of the best.....a must for any King fan.
"
"
  Love this timeless book. Scared the daylights out of me when I first read it 3 decades ago, and still did the second time! It's a shame they did a movie that was comical, when this was really tragic.
"
"
  I have been a fan of Stephen king for many years and read many, many of his books but not The Shining. I don't know why I didn't read it but I just didn't do it. I am glad I waited until now because that made it all the more special.  It reminded me why I loved his books in the first place, the special horrors that only King could bring to you. I had never read this type of books until I read his. So I'm glad I saved this book till now.
"
"
  Super good for teens. Great story and book. Not too intense for a little younger readers. So read and enjoy!
"
"
  With the publication of Doctor Sleep I was inspired to read the Shining and was not disappointed that I did.  Despite having seen the movie, Stephen King's decades old thriller still has the ability to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Understanding the characters history and how that influences their actions only added to richness of the story.  If you enjoy the horror/thriller genre and have not read ""The Shining,"" I recommend picking it up today.  Just be sure you have some time to spare, as once you pick it you won't want to put it down.
"
"
  I re-read this book after 20-plus years and after seeing the film. It continues to be okay, but that's the highest rating I can give. Perhaps the horror-factor has diminished with the years. I read the intro to the follow-up which wasn't slightly interesting to know about the alcoholic life of the youngest star of book and movie, Danny. If you've never read this, you must, but for revisitors  it will be an aged disappointment.
"
"
  This is an awesome book. One of King's better ones and that's saying something. The dude knows madness, that's for sure.
"
"
  It was given as a gift to a Steven King fan
"
"
  You definitely owe it to yourself to read this great story from the master.  Keep in mind if you have seen the Kubrick movie it is much different than the original story that King wrote, actually there is very little that is the same. Both are very scary but King's story is much more an in depth study of the mad man that is Jack Torrance.  Excellent book for the Kindle, I was done with the story before I knew it, a true page turner.
"
"
  Pretty darn good book. Wasn’t as creepy as I thought it was going to be. It’s mostly just gory and thought provoking.
"
"
  I liked the book way more than the movie. The book was much more profound, yet the imagery was just as thrilling if not more. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a look into the good and bad of human nature and the world around us. Stephen King is quite enjoyable.
"
"
  enjoyable before-after-during the movie
"
"
  Reading is one of my favorite hobbies, but I will admit sometimes it takes me a while to get sucked into a book to the point I couldn't sit it down. Well that wasn't the case with this book, I even purchased it as an audio book so that I didn't have to stop the story while I'm at work. Since finishing this book I have reread it 3 times and it doesn't get old. As soon as I thought I was at a good stopping point something more exciting would happen!! I definitely recommend this book!
"
"
  Mint condition! Absolutely love!!!!!!
"
"
  Despite the fact that this was written so long ago, and many of the elements are nostalgic (party lines for one) this book still manages to make you want to turn all the lights on in the house as you settle down to read another chapter. If you're like me, and you can't put a good book down, this will be a super fast read. The characters are well developed and engaging, and you really get to caring about them. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this title.
"
"
  Enjoyed this.... but it was slow moving for me.  Loved getting a deeper feeling of the characters and experiencing an alternate ending!  But I read this is spurts for well over a month, maybe more.
"
"
  I'm honestly sad that this book is over. I love Stephen King, and have read quite a few of his books and still have plenty to go.This is the first time I can honestly say, this book scared me. I couldn't read it at night, before bed, or in the dark.The horror elements began so subtly, it felt like fear slowly crept up on me the further I read. True, honest, psychological horror that didn't rely solely on gore or cheap scares.My only regret is that I waited so long to read this book, which I now understand why is one of the best classic horror books to exist.
"
"
  I had never seen the movie to spoil the book for me.  I hadn't read a King book in years.  The Shining was just ok.  Being regarded as the king of horror, I think I was expecting a different feel for the novel.  It wasn't bad.  Expectations are more on the reader I guess...

  Great book I love Stephen King books
"
"
  One of my favorites from Stephen King!
"
"
  Stephen King is by far my favorite author.  No one else can grab me from the first paragraph and suck me in to the whole story the way he can.This is one of his scariest, in my opinion.  It's something we can relate to.  Being completely isolated up on a snowed in mountain top.  No way to get down. No way to get help.  And your husband/father starts really going nutso.  Love this book!
"
"
  This is my second reading of The Shining. I've read it so long ago that it was like I was reading it for the first time. I kept on comparing the book to the movie, and while the movie we good, the book is better. I liked the description of the hedge animals, and the friendship between Dock and the boy. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a  fan of Stephen King, Joe Hill, or any other writer of horror/suspense genre.
"
"
  Awesome book from an awesome author.
"
"
  I like this book but I liked more the movie, you have to read this book if you really want to understand what is happening in the movie. You will enjoy more the movie after reading this book.
"
"
  I pre-ordered Stephen King's ""Dr Sleep"" and realized I remembered nothing about ""The Shining"", the book that leads into Dr Sleep.  So I ordered and read ""The Shining"" and understand why I didn't remember it; hadn't read it at all!A very enjoyable ghost story/haunted house story. The ""old"" Stephen King with plenty of horror, slow boiling terror and an unlikely hero.  This was a very good summer read.
"
"
  Hey, it's King and all that that means. I reread it in anticipation of Santa bring me Doctor Sleep. Glad I did because I'd forgotten how different it is from the movie. Lots of the iconic scenes in the movie are not in the book but the book has many more of its own. The ending is completely different and I liked both.You definitely get more insight into Danny (the boy) in the book.Recommended.
"
"
  Stephen King you are phenomenal. I keep thinking you just cannot keep topping the last book of yours that I have read.  But yo do. I am such a fan. I had to reread the shining for two reasons.  First, because I have not read it since it originally came out, and secondly because I purchased Doctor Sleep. I will be returning shortly with my review on Doctor Sleep. Thank you for your writings Mr. King.
"
"
  I guess because I love the Kubrick movie so much it’s jarring to read the original story after the fact. I’m a big Stephen King fan but this one didn’t connect w me. I’m sure it would’ve been different if I’d red it before swing the movie multiple times over the years.
"
"
  King is a great story teller. You get to know the characters so well. I guess that’s why you care what happens to them.
"
"
  Reread to prepare for sequel Dr Sleep, read and audio made enjoyable and then watched movie again. Stephen King ruled terror!!!
"
"
  I bought Doctor Sleep thinking that it was okay for me to have  only seen the Kubrick film of The Shining. But a nagging feeling kept telling me that I'd always heard that Stephen King had not approved of the Kubrick film and that it was not the same story as the book. So, after making to chapter 4 or so, I quit Doctor Sleep to return to the beginning of it all!  I'm so glad I did-a much better story and I understand more.
"
"
  I seen some reviews with the book being damaged. But it came in very good condition! I can’t wait to read it!
"
"
  Haven’t read this in near 40 years. What Ana amazing book. Found myself rooting for Jack the whole time even though I knew how it would end.
"
"
  Classic read. Having not watched the movie before-hand, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Must buy, and must-read. Just bought the sequel, Doctor Sleep. Excited to see how little Danny Torrance turned out as an adult after his fairly traumatic experiences at the Overlook..........hehehe.
"
"
  I came back to read this book after reading the follow up, Doctor Sleep. Years ago when it came out I just couldn't get through it because I didn't like the character Jack. Well this time around was better but it was slow going and made me sleepy. I still didn't like the character of Jack and there was a lot of Jack in this book. I liked the concept a lot, every twisted detail, but I think the pace was just too slow for me.
"
"
  I've just now read The Shining and have only seen bits and pieces of the movie. The book was excellent! The only fault I found was that Danny seemed too far advanced in thought for a 5-yr-old boy... Perhaps his character would have been more believable to me had he been 7 or 8. Aside from that, the book was an excellent thrill ride and impossible to put down! Now on to Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  Highly recommend this book. Much better than the movies. Now I must read the next book. One of Kings best. Could not stop reading many times. Had me hanging on.
"
"
  I recommend a re-read as a reminder of how much better the book is than the movie, though the movie is pretty good! Issues of ESP, domestic violence, alcoholism, and then some really scary stuff just for fun.
"
"
  One of kings better works. In typical king fashion, the dialogue is  clunky, but overall this is a great story!
"
"
  The book is SO much better than the movie. I now begin the sequel.  This is by far my favorite King book.
"
"
  Stephen king is always great
"
"
  Bought as a gift she loved it.
"
"
  This is easily King's most well-written piece, and I've read many of them at this point. I saved this for later while I was working my way through his stuff (Dark Tower I-VII, Dreamcatcher, Cujo, Needful Things, IT, Tommyknockers, Skeleton Crew, Dark Half, etc).Jack swings from likeable to tragic to terrifying over the course of the story, in addition to the other elements of life in the Overlook Hotel that mirror his inevitable slide into insanity. At times, you identify with his hatred of Wendy constantly nagging him for sins of the past. Other times, you see Wendy's POV as her husband intentionally distances himself from the family.Very few novels today would tackle child abuse so frankly and openly, in addition to the themes of isolation, despair, and a cycle of violent, alcohol-fueled destruction. It's an amazing book, and should be required reading by anyone who loves great characters.

  I had to get this book into my Kindle.  I have been reading and rereading The Shining since I was in junior high.  There is something about the horror of Stephen King that makes all the other horror stories and movies out there just plain 'shallow'.  Now, my teenagers are beginning their adventures with King.  I started them with The Shining.  I love that they are finding that the movie is never as good as the book.  Perfect.
"
"
  After loving the movie for years, I decided to actually look at the ""source!"" It's different enough that it was a new journey at the Overlook. Really puts a whole new perspective behind the characters and their motivations. It was easy to pick out what imagery they used for the movie, and super creepy with whole new twists and madness, with all characters being haunted the whole way through.
"
"
  Absolutely loved this book, it did come a little damaged but that is expected since it's a paperback but definitely would recommend I have made it my goal to read all of Stephen king's books.
"
"
  I read this when it first came out ad liked it. I bought it again to reread so I would have it fresh in my mind so I could read Doctor Sleep. It's been cold with bad weather here in Maine so the setting in the book is striking a chord with me. LOL A good psychological thriller. King is master of taking the ordinary and twisting it so it hits home as a can be possible situation in a way.
"
"
  I read this book for the first time when I was 16 and it scared me so bad that I couldn't read another horror novel for years. I recently bought to reread so that I can refresh my memory of the characters, before I read the sequel ""Doctor Sleep"".If you love ghost stories and being scared, I highly recommend this book. But maybe leave the light on at night. Oh, and don't read it when you're all alone. Spooky!
"
"
  For hubs. He loves it. Arrived packaged well and on time.
"

  This is the first Stephen King Book that I have read before. I immediately was sucked it to the book. The way that Stephen King is able to describe scenery is incredible. It kept me wanting to read this book at all hours.This was the first book that I couldn't read in the dark by myself. Just to frightening. The book gave me chills and I am now going to be reading many more King books.WORTH THE READ.
"
"
  Great Book!!!  Stephen King is just that!  The KING of Horror and Suspense.  His characters come alive because his character development is deeply detailed.  A person is able to ""get inside the mind of the character"" and know his or her motivations and prejudices and fears.  The Shining is a true page turner, because the reader is truly invested each character's emotional pulls and the resulting chaos, of which there is an abundance.  There are many paranormal aspects to this novel.
"
"
  I had only read a few of King's books prior to this one. This is a really excellent book based upon a most intriguing concept which is quite plausible.The story line is clear and coherent. As usual King has thought this through carefully and recorded it well. The story moves quickly and is quite captivating.It is a good read; very suspenseful!
"
"
  If you haven't read this start moe. A classic of the gente what are you waiting for. The greatest modern day writer celebrate his genius now amd forever. Without SK there wouldn't be a horror genre at least in it's curtent itenetation.  Read him and celebrate the masters voice.
"
"
  It had been at least twenty years since I read this book the first time.  Then it popped up as a kindle daily deal the day after I read the sequel Dr. Sleep so I figured that must be a sign and purchased it.  It's lost none of its spookiness and psychological terror.  The seventies pop culture and setting remain, and I appreciate that.  I so wish that had been the case with the re-issue of The Stand.  Well worth the $1.99 purchase price.
"
"
  I read this 25 years ago and it was so scary I had trouble sleeping.  Cut to 25 years later and despite my belief that it wouldn't be scary as an adult, it still managed to get in my head.  This is a downright frightening story and an excellent and gripping read.  I re-read this because I am a devoted Stephen King fan, but also in preparation/anticipation of the sequel coming in fall ""Doctor Sleep"".  I cannot wait!Sidenote: I highly recommend ""Blaze"" if you're looking for a great read.  It's from the sadly unloved Richard Bachman/Stephen King group of books, but this story doesn't disappoint.
"
"
  Stephen King is such an amazing author.  I love all his books.  This is no exception.  I had seen the movie several times and it only left me with a ton of questions.  The book answers them all!
"
"
  Hard to write a review on such an iconic book.  I was set against reading it since I had seen the movie as a kid and thouhgt I knew too much to really enjoy the book.  I am glad that I made the choice to read it!  Of course and as usually is the case, the book is better than the movie.  It was awesome to read how each character handles the stress of being ""trapped"" in the hotel.
"
"
  Good. But too claustrophobic. Because everything takes place in that big vacant hotel, events become sort of predictable. You soon know that just when it looks like things can't get any worse, they will. Again. And again. And again. But I still enjoyed the book. It just didn't grab me the way some of his 5 star books like The Stand, Misery, It, and The Green Mile did.
"
"
  This is by far my favorite Stephen King book, ever! I cannot tell you how many times I've read it and it's just as thrilling, exciting, and suspenseful as the first time. The movie does this book no justice whatsoever and I love the movie, but King's amazing writing is just not reflected in the movie. The Shining makes you feel like you're descending into madness with Jack and I absolutely love it.
"
"
  But I am going to try...This book, whoa, what can I say.  Absolutely incredible writing here.  It is a monument of a book that fly's by you so quickly despite its length.  If you have seen the movie, go read the book.  There are a number of things that are different, and in my opinion, better, in the book.  The characters are so rich and developed that you are rooting for everyone, including Jack.  King's prose is so rich and fluid that you almost don't want to read another book after this one.  It isn't so much as a horror novel as it is a suspenseful, well written and supernatural. Go read this book, you will NOT regret it!!
"
"
  This was a great book. I couldn't put it down.It was definitely out of my normal book styles, to pick. I usually read love/romance novels. This was the first horror book I've read. Stephen king, captured my interest in the first couple of pages. He took me on a journey through mAny different peoples thoughts. Even with jack turning out the way he did, Stephen King had me feeling sorry and heartfelt towards him.At one point, when I was reading ""The Shining"", in bed, I got so frightened I had to turn on my flashlight.This book was written better then any book I've ever read.I look forward to reading more books by Stephen King.
"
"
  This one is a timeless work of horror, suspense, isolation, and desperation.  This tale is taken down a road paved by raw, even poetic literary technique.  It's a work of terrifying and grotesque art.  A must read for anyone seeking a morose, chilling, fear filled and twisted journey through the mind of a monster.
"
"
  After ""The Stand,"" this is definitely King's best work. The characters ate fully drawn and realistic and this includes The Overlook Hotel as well, as it features not only as the setting, but a main player in this novel. A must read for any Stephen King fan (the film doesn't shine a light compared to the novel). Classic horror and psychological study of a man fighting his demons and the consequences for him and his family.
"
"
  A great read, with a laid back prose style. It's vastly different from Kubrick's movie. Every time someone mentions this novel the movie is also mentioned, and they compare and contrast the two. If you've seen the movie put it out of your mind while reading this or the two may cause a constant confliction within your head.
"
"
  This is the ultimate ghost story. A gifted child, a recovering alcoholic, and the woman who loves them both. The characters are believable and deep and the story will keep you turning pages in anticipation.
"
"
  I've seen the movie many times and finally decided to read the book. As with most movies and books, there are differences and the book dives much deeper into characters background and thoughts.  If you want to know more about these characters and the Overlook Hotel, give the book a read.
"
"
  I've read a lot of Stephen King's books, but for some reason I just recently got around to reading The Shining. As most everyone knows, this is one of SK's classics. Oh, and the movie in no way does justice to the book, so even if you've seen the movie you should read the book. I recently purchased Doctor Sleep, which is the sequel to The Shining. I'm expecting great things.
"
"
  My first ever Stephen King read. I read the book and then watched the movie. Definitely enjoyed the book ending way more than the movie and would recommend the read if you have the time. The book kept me very entertained, I wanted to keep reading and I hated putting it down. On to the next one... “IT”.
"
"
  This is a great book if you can get through the first half or so. I feel like its very detailed (not like LOTR crazy detailed) and some of it really wasn't needed. The first half feels a little long since it is mostly needed backstory The second half of the book is simply amazing and I wish that the movie would have actually been like the book. Unlike the movie, you will feel a connection with Jack that you would never admit to from just watching the movie and Wendy isn't as annoying and whiny. Please, PLEASE do not judge this book on the movie. While the movie is great in its own right the only thing they have in common are the characters. This book is one of my favorite Stephen King novels.
"
"
  Still a good read!
"
"
  So much better than the movie!The book not only made Jack a sympathetic character, but it was scarier!I look forward to reading Dr Sleep
"
"
  Gorgeous BiG book
"
"
  I love Stephen King. In fact his more recent Novel, 11/22/63 is one of the most engrossing books I've read in years, I got bored reading The Shining. It's not that the plot was was uneventful, (of course it was), or the characters under-developed, (he's a master at this), it's just that it was about three times as long as it needed to be.
"
"
  I love the details of the hotel. The change in jack and how it used his weaknesses. The hedges were my favorite.
"
"
  excellent book with no dull moments. No issues with shipping or the book itself at all.
"
"
  ""The Shining"" is everything, especially a classic. Most of you reading this are probably considering reading this after watching Stanley Kubrick's 1980 adaptation and I must say that the book is much more mysterious and captivating. While in Kubrick's version Jack Torrance is suffering from a classic case of cabin fever, it is a completely different set of circumstances in the book. I won't spoil what makes the horror of the book better but I will say that if you enjoyed Kubrick's, you absolutely must read the original story.
"
"
  Very different story line.  Hard to put down!  Keeps you involved until the end.  Excellent read.  Can’t wait to read the sequel
"
"
  Perfect Pricing for a classic. Thank you!
"
"
  I loved this book so much I could scream. This was my first dive into scary Stephen King (previously read and loved The Green Mile, and have read Shawshank as well), and I absolutely couldn’t put it down. It was absolutely phenomenal.
"
"
  A good yarn is still a thing of beauty even after so much time has passed. Mr. King wrote a great story populated with compelling characters that I still care about all these years later. The sequel, Doctor Sleep, is a suitably good continuation of the story too. Read them both!
"
"
  Mint condition
"
"
  This is the third time reading this book. I am sure I will again. If you haven’t you it to yourself. It’s a fun ride.
"
"
  LOVE THIS BOOK.  As usual, the movie doesn't do it justice.  I love everything by Stephen King.  I would recommend Insomnia if you like this.
"
"
  The modern ghost story that still scares us young and old.  I love how King gives us the history and story behind The Overlook Hotel.  It may see like a waste to some but it is what makes the story so compelling.  Even with it all the fans would love to know more of the Hotel's history.  Ignore the movie read the book (a good idea for most of the adaptations from King's works)
"
"
  Perfect for a snowbound winter weekend! Lock the doors!
"
"
  Enjoyed the movie, read the book after. The movie did a serious injustice to the storyline especially the ending.
"
"
  I never believed I could be so affected by a book of fiction. I've read a couple of Stephen King's books and short stories years ago, but I felt ill prepared to handle the imagery contained within these pages. The level of detail he describes really brings the characters to life, and you enter a weird world that lies between fiction and reality while you read. Superb!
"
"
  In my opinion The Shining is Stephen King's best. I think the book is much better than the movie although the movie is also my favorite Stephen King based movie. This was written back when Stephen King was on his game and you can tell when you compare it to some of the stuff he has come out with lately. Love this book and I get appropriately creeped out every time I read it.
"
"
  I read Dr. Sleep a while back and had never read the prequel.  Like most of King's screen attempts, the Shining movie had given me a much different perspective from the book.  You can definitely see the maturity in his writing when you put the two pieces side by side.  Equally important, you can see King's view of his own personal demons change.  Now I'm going to re-read Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  Good product
"
"
  Chilling read. I am a fan of Stephen King and this classic does not disappoint.
"
"
  A gripping exciting read
"
"
  Of course it’s good!
"
"
  I read this book originally when I was in the 8th or 9th grade. The only thing I really remembered about it was those damn hedge animals. I still don't want box elders or any other ""trimmed"" plant in my yard. It was better than I remember and scarier (not as bloody) as the movie. I would suggest reading it or re-reading it before reading Doctor Sleep but DO read Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  I am a very big King fan. This is my 3rd read of this book and it still sends chills up my spine when I read it. I saw the movie and the book is just as good if not better. The images that King paints with his words are just outstanding. I had to buy this for the Kindle because I wore my original books spine out. I am so glad to have it again. It had been a number of years but again still one of his bests,
"
"
  Having seen the movie years ago, I have only read this book recently and was pleasantly surprised.  Of course, we all know that any book made into a movie must be reduced greatly to fit the constraints of the film.  This original novel had so much more meat (poor choice of words?) to it that I enjoyed it more than the film.If you're looking for a good read, especially when snowbound, try this one!
"
"
  Great read
"
"
  Great book
"
"
  Always exciting and intriguing.  I wanted to compare the book with the first movie.  Lots of similarities and many differences.  I kept seeing the movie characters, but enjoyed the differences in the personalities.  Enjoy it for yourself.
"
"
  I came upon this book after becoming a fan of the feature film version, but I absolutely enjoyed finding out more about the characters, their background, and the Overlook. It was a thrilling book that gave me chills many times over. Definitely worth reading even if you have seen and enjoyed the movie.
"
"
  As described
"
"
  Wow!  So much more than what Kubrick did to the movie. The complexities & focus of this masterful story makes me wonder how I ever even understood the movie. Bravo Mr King! Two thumbs down Mr Kubrick.
"
"
  Was part of a 3 pack set and was a gift for my son
"
"
  Great book to read even if you have seen the movie tons of times!!  There are some differences throughout the story including the ending, so it's just as suspenseful.  I recommend if you love horror.
"
"
  What can I say. A reread from 40 years ago. Still great
"
"
  Great book to read!
"
"
  very good
"
"
  Awesome book.
"
"
  Read this again before Doctor Sleep was released.  I read it 30 years ago and was amazed at how much I remembered and also how much I'd forgotten.  Knowing how it ended did not distract from the elevated heartrate I experienced while reading one of King's best stories.  Personally, I place The Shining in my top 5 King novels. Classic American Lit at it's best.
"
"
  A classic! Still holds up, very well.  An addictive read, that is truly intense.  A must read for any horror fan.
"
"
  WooHoo...saw the movie, thought that was enough, til a cousin said, oh no, Read the BOOK!  I AM!  What a difference!!  NEVER judge a book by it's movie, for real!
"
"
  Very suspenseful. It was even better than the movie. King is a great writer and this is definitely one of his best.
"
"
  It's interesting. Why would the hotel want to have Jack kill Danny when his ""shine"" is what made the hotel stronger? And at the very end Halloran was being encouraged to kill Danny and his mom. If the house was being destroyed why was the evil entity still able to use its power to exterminate them? And where did this evil end up going if it could do that?
"
"
  I decided to read this book before reading the new novel Dr. Sleep.  I had seen the movie years ago, but never read the book.  I love King's older books, but frankly lost interest in more recent years as his writing changed.  This is the King I knew and loved when he first started writing!  I can't wait to finish to start reading Dr. Sleep!
"
"
  Never saw the movie but heard great things about both the book and the movie. I'm the type of person who really tries to read the book before the movie and I LOVED this book.
"
"
  Most loved author of all time, since I was a young girl! Will be reading the sequal and can not wait to see what comes next!!
"
"
  Great novel. A classic. A referent for King's style.
"
"
  I grew up with Stephen King . . . Mom is a big fan of horror books and film. Having read many (not all) of his works, I was surprised that ""The Shining"" had not been one of them. I am glad that I read this (not only to get any references made in ""Dr. Sleep""), but just because it was a good read. I enjoyed it and was able to keep the Kubrick film version out of my mind (for most of it).
"
"
  Great
"
"
  I read the book after watching the movie.  The book was surprisingly different other than the setting.  I think the circumstances of the family being at the hotel for the winter are not portrayed well in the movie.  The ending was much better than the movie.  The movie, although a great acting performance by Jack Nicholson, did not portray the book's intent I did not think.
"
"
  I'm glad I picked this one up. not really knowing much about the book and very little about the  movie, I thought I would start with the book first. this book definitely have me the creeps reading this. Especially  reading about room 217. I enjoyed reading this and look forward to reading the sequel soon.
"
"
  I read this book when it first came out, down in my basement bedroom all alone after dark, and I was afraid to open the door.I saw the movie when it came out and thought the book was better.This time the book is still scary and creepy. One's imagination is better than anything Hollywood can think up.Now I'm ready for the sequel.
"
"
  If you are a fan of the movie this is a MUST read.  It is better because it has more character descriptions and story lines.  It doesn't ruin the movie but a slightly different twist.
"
"
  First off, this is the scariest book I have read. I am not sure if it's the masterful way King makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up with his writing, or the fact that his characters are so deep and real that I feel like I'm there with them as The Overlook Hotel begins to come alive. I have read a lot of Stephen King's work but only when reading this one do I find myself having to set down the book and take a deep breath and remind myself I'm not in a hotel in Colorado.
"
"
  Still as good as the first time I read it.  Good literature is rare and this is a rare piece of literature. I read it this time after finishing ""Doctor Sleep"" (which is absolutely one of the best books I've ever read - I gave up my Saturday to read it straight through) as a refresher (you don't need to read it before ""Doctor Sleep"" but it reminded me of the back story.
"
"
  Not totally convincing situations, especially those involving Danny. It seems that this story is out of touch with its time. Most of us have read stories that were scarier or delved deeper into extra sensory perceptions. I would have been happier with a story which spent more time in weaving some sort of a ""dialogue"" between one or more human characters and the ""sphere of the unknown"".
"
"
  Classic Horror/Suspense at it's best. If you've seen the movie and haven't read the book - turn off the tube and read. The book is infinitely better and the movie was fantastic.
"
"
  I loved the movie until I read the book. I don’t blame Stephen King for being pissed. READ THE BOOK!! It is a thousand times better.
"
"
  I gave five stars because this book has everything a good book requires: a beginning, middle and ending as well as likable characters.  This is a great story and just as suspenseful as it was when I read it sometime in the1970's.  I think the book is sooo much better than the movie.  A small boy fighting evil in the form of his father.  Loved it!
"
"
  I saw the movie, a halloween favorite and remebered reading some of his work in High school.  So I ordered the book...soooo much better than the movie..a real page turner...and I got the Doctor Sleep for my birthday..thanks moma!  and I love that one too...I even got a library card and check out a few more of his older books.  I love the way they take me back to the 70's and 80's ..Thurnderbird Hotel and kent cigaretts!
"
"
  It takes a while to get started but worth the wait. The setting and characters are all interesting and develop well over the story.
"
"
  This book came is perfect condition and it was a great price I loved it so much!!
"
"
  You must read The Shining to really appreciate the intricacies of the plot and the true ""STORY"" King put down to paper. Kubric's movie version does not touch the horror King wrote about this haunted hotel. Read the novel and try to forget the movie and you will truly appreciate the master of horror stories tale of seclusion and madness
"
"
  Fantastic story, unable to put it downHave wanted to read this book for years and it definitely did not disappoint
"
"
  I read a few Stephen King's work such as Carrie, Needful Things, Cell, Different Seasons, Thinner, Misery. I am not sure why I didn't start with some of his stronger work like The Shinning. So, I went into The Shinning with a very high expectation. I am glad to say that it met my expectations and more. In his other works, I find that he is long winded and spent a lot of time on details of each character. And so I was hoping that The Shinning isn't like that. And it isn't. Unlike his later works, The Shinning strike a balance between character development without going into all the unnecessary details. It was so encouraging that I went and bought 'Salem's Lot. I hope this early classic delivers as well.
"
"
  Great print of a great book!
"
"
  King 's ability to propel the story by giving a meaningful narrative from the perspective of each character gave this story so much more depth than I thought it would have. It's eerie, thoughtful, and compelling. If you liked the movie I think you'd love the book. It's a fun read and although Kubrick's film is captivating, I think I might actually enjoy King 's plot a little more.
"
"
  Great price and quality.  Love Stephen King.  This is top 3 King book of all time in my opinion.  Finished in a few days I was so hooked!  You won't regret this purchase.
"
"
  I LOVE Stephen King the author. He is really great as an author. Pretty funny as an ""actor"" and I put that the way I did because he is NOT an actor, he just appears in his movies for fun, I think, because he's a terrible actor. The opposite of his writing ability. I have a collection of his books, and every time I can afford another, I get it. Every time.
"
"
  This book is my second Stephen King book and I must say it was an amazing read. Started out kind slow and wordy but it was definitely worth it and everything made sense in the end. Definitely gonna pick up the next book in the series (Doctor Sleep).
"
"
  The movie scared the crap out of me when it was first in theaters.But I loved it. I've read 5 King books, now getting around to 'the big ones'. So much fun
"
"
  This book was clearly not new since it was missing the first two chapters of the book. I would avoid this vendor.
"
"
  One of King's best novels ever. I owned it for decades. It was destroyed so I bought a new one.
"
"
  An all time favorite!
"
"
  One of SK's best books.  The characters are filled with complex emotions and gripping with otherwordly touches.  Please read the book and then see the movie by S. Kubrick.  The book has such nuance and the story is the Overlook hotel not J. Nicholson's character.  Fantastic reading.
"
"
  You always hear (or see) ""One of Kings best!"". In this case that's actually true. I've read many of Kings books, and the Shining's in my top 3. Short but fantastic read.
"
"
  what a classic
"
"
  The book is entirely different, and entirely better-especially if you enjoy more action and suspense! I couldn’t put in down.
"
"
  Suspense builds as you follow the lives of the main characters. If you've read King before, you know thathe builds the suspense up before allowing the actionto start. Wished I had read book before watching film.The hotel hides much more evil and the characters have more depth. Parts that were left out of movie really addmore intensity to the plot and characters.  -Hope you enjoy !
"
"
  So frightening. So inspiring. I loved every moment. If you’re considering purchasing it, just do it. I couldn’t put it down.
"
"
  If you've seen the movie, I think that you will find the book interesting although a bit long.  The characters and framework are the same but the stories are different.
"
"
  One of kings earlier works and although he's a great writer, he broke some writing rules that bothered me. For me this was the tare book that I thought was better as a movie. I'm just not a fan of so many filthy words, sexual references, and graphic abuse, especially of a child. Still, who will ever forget the Overlook  hotel and Redrum?
"
"
  I read this recently on my Kindle after having read it in paperback probably 20 years ago. If ever a book qualifies as a ""timeless classic"" this is it. If you enjoy literary suspense/horror/thrillers and have never read THE SHINING then you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy.
"
"
  As a work of suspense, or of the paranormal, or as a study in the deterioration of a human mind, this easily earns 5 stars. I read it when it first came out; somehow over the years it morphed into a completely different book in my mind. I'm very glad I read it again, as it's far better than I remembered. King' s ability to draw completely believable characters doing unimaginable things is uncanny.
"
"
  I am one of King's Constant Readers. And having been born when this book came out was too young to read this level of King novel. Not that newer novels are not as good, but there is no reference to towers here and it is just about Danny and his struggles overcoming this terrible place. The Dark Tower novels are amazing with the exception of the final chapters of the series. But I noticed the influence that the tower has on every one of Kings newer books. It's a stronghold. I actually read Dr. Sleep first and it stayed true to the story line. It got me interested in the back story. And for folks that haven't read one book or the other, they should read both.
"
"
  It's a good work
"
"
  The movie was better. A small part of me wanted to just drop the mike and walk away. But I like to expound upon my perceptions, even if I’m doing it for my own pleasure and edification. First, I’d like to thank Trudi (aka The Busty Book Bimbo) for throwing down the gauntlet and calling yours truly to the red carpet. Yes, she may have called me out a while ago, but I’m from West Virginia, and we tend to talk and move a little slow.  And, yeah, I had the movie version in the back of my mind with Jack Nicholson at his finest level of insanity. Rather than break the spell, I wanted to hold onto my crazy ways.THE SHINING was a slow bleed for me. Sure, it was freaky and crazy and had a certain level of insanity and madness, but it’d take me about three days to bleed out. The movie version, however, bled me out in less than twenty minutes. That flick was crazy. And grotesque. And strange. And weird. And the way Jack Nicholson pounded away at the keys…well, that reminded me of the great man himself slaving over his typewriter in the 1970s with a gleam in his eye and a razorblade in his hip pocket.But Stephen King never quite captures that level of horror for me, where I’m sleeping with my Honey Boo Boo nightlight and sucking my thumb for a week at a time. He freaks me out a little, like an itch I can’t quite scratch, and I may look over my shoulder once or twice, before I move on with my life. And, sure, I get the feeling that he might be a little bit nuts, because genius and hovering outside the norm walk hand-in-hand across I-95. But that’s where I meet the brick wall going at 70 mph in the slow lane.The story dragged along a bit longer than necessary. Sure, the man can spin a yarn better than Calvin Klein, but a little brevity never hurt anybody, and unfortunately, you won’t find it here. That being said, though, I’m glad I was taken to task for my novel skipping ways, and I shall make a more valiant attempt in the future at staying on top of things. When I do, I shall most definitely alert the proper authorities.Oh, and I may never stay in a hotel in rural Colorado. But I’ll kindly thank Stanley Kubrick for that one.Robert DownsAuthor of Falling Immortality and Graceful Immortality

  I love I can have this for kindle... My old book just couldn't take anymore so it was done & over with years ago. Glad to see it offered at a fair price especially since it's close to Halloween. I was sure it was going to be marked up, but good old Amazon made my day! Anyone familiar with King's writing will be satisfied with a nice long read filled with what King does best, horror.
"
"
  After seeing the movie again, I decided to read the book for a second time. The book develops the characters to a much greater degree, which makes for a better story. Jack,s decent into madness is more comprehensive in the book, for instance. The Danny/Tony character is also expanded on greatly there. The movie misses out on Danny's thought process. He is as much of the protagonist  as Jack.
"
"
  What an excellent read. This scary yet heartfelt classic is as good today as it ever was. The combination of real and psychological horrors blend together seamlessly and really shed light on the vulnerability of the characters. This book definitely leaves the Kubrick movie feeling cold and empty by comparison. A must read for any horror fan.
"
"
  After reading Kings new novel,  Dr. Sleep,  I decided to go back and read the Shinning again.  It was surprisingly still a great read.  With Dr. Sleep still fresh in my mind,  it helped to go back and see how it all started. Dr. Sleep was such a good book,  I think many more copies of the Shinning will be sold to people with the same interest.  You will be rewarded for the effort.
"
"
  Arrived in great condition, fantastic read.
"
"
  I watched the movie years ago so I wanted to read the book. The book is so much better than the movie. I am so glad I read this book. I think it was well worth reading. After I read the book I watched the movie again. The movie was so horrible compared to the book.
"
"
  I read this book in college.  It was a treat.  I just finished again.  It was better the second time around.  Though there are a few typos it is still an excellent read.  Thrilling, suspense driven and even without the film, to back it up, it brings the reader into the written words.  It's colourful, thought out and exquisitely crafted.
"
"
  I'm only about a third of the way through the book, but it's great so far. I like Jack's gradual slide into insanity.
"
"
  I have seen the movie, ""The Shining"" many times and I have also watched the television mini-series.  I enjoyed them both.  However, nothing compares to the book.  The charm of Shining isn't in the scares, it is the relationships.  King really understands the strains and pressures of family dynamics.  There is a pain to ""getting along"" that you rarely see depicted in other media the way King can create in a story.  It is beautifully insightful, plus there are monsters...  both living and dead.  This story can't be beat.
"
"
  Fantastic book I like it so much better than the movie. Really does give you a creepy feeling
"
"
  I like S. King books, but extremely picky on which ones I read- The Stand and IT are my favorites and I have read both of them 3 times over the years. I bought The Shining so I could have a good base to read Dr. Sleep next, and the third party I bought it from on Amazon made it a perfect addition to my hardcover collection.
"
"
  This is the best out of his first three novels. I didn't think Carrie could be topped, but with more experience and patient writing, King has out done himself. Every chapter has a purpose, every subject away from the main characters is nessassary. There are moments where your brain just clicks after reading something that finally connects 3 chapters later. Great climax, awesome ending. A must read!
"
"
  Not a horror buff, read this as a study of the horror genre; BUT the writing, imagery, and plot are absolute perfection. It also creeps sufficiently and at several points had my hair standing in end with a feeling of unease. 10/10.
"
"
  I never read The Shining until I read Doctor Sleep.  I had only watched Kubrick's movie and was I surprised when the Overlook Hotel burned down! and Hallorann had not died!  So I had to get The Shining to see what other elements Kubrick changed from the book.  I'm glad I did because the book went into much more detail about Wendy and other things.  I still like the idea of the maze better than the topiary's.
"
"
  If you have ever seen the Movie you really should read the book as it will make you say Oh I see why that was in the move !Really opens up the whole history of everyone in the book and the setting,
"
"
  It's Stephen King, so you know the writing will be grammatically correct and tight.  He will follow through on the story line.  Less than 5 stars because it felt like there was something missing toward the end.  For a long story there could have been more to the denouement and Jack's decline.
"
"
  Absolutely amazing. If you have seen the movie but not read the book you are missing out. The way Stephen King transitions between character perspectives is incredible. Not to mention this book will give you the creeps but also sucks you into the lives of this poor family and makes you feel for Jack Torrance in a way that the movie does not do justice. No offense Kubrick, your movie was great, but this book was another level! Don't read alone at night!
"
"
  I always wanted to read this book and when i found out that there was a sequel for it being released in September I jumped on it right away.  The story is good, really good, not scary but very intense, very suspencfull.  It was written in the seventies and a sequel for it will be released for it later this year.  I can hardly wait.
"
"
  I read Doctor Sleep and didn't realize that it was a sequel to The Shining.  I had heard of The Shining movie and had seen some parts of it but only knew it was a horror film written by Stephen King.  However, I realize now that The Shining movie is nothing compared to the book.  The book is better though I have not seen the movie in full.This book focuses on the story of a family that takes a job in a hotel in Sidewinder, CO during the winter months.  Little do the folks know (although the little boy, Danny, does know because he has ""the shining"" according to the cook at the Overlook Hotel), the hotel is haunted beyond their wildest dreams.  The hotel slowly begins to tear apart the family as the ghosts seek to take over Danny for his gift.  I will not give more away than that.Overall this is a good story.  I don't like books with cursing or with sexuality so I was turned off to that aspect of the book.  The language, at times, is harsh.  Yet King is a good writer and a master at looking into the psychology of his characters.I read Doctor Sleep then came back and read The Shining.  Both are excellent books.  Both tell incredible stories.
"
"
  The movie doesn’t do justice to Sai King’s fabulous book ‘The Shining’. You actually sweat and Trimble along with the characters.  There’s not anything better than to settle in with a King book in your hands, and a cat on your lap. Don’t forget to leave the light on.
"
"
  It was a book what can I really say, it wasn't damaged. I've had it for about 3 months and I'm only on pg 20...wish me luck.
"
"
  This was an amazing book! Spine tingling, creepy story.
"
"
  I read Dr. Sleep and realized I had never read The Shining, just saw the movie. Both have their merits. I enjoyed the fuller characterization of all the main characters. Reading Dr. Sleep will be more rewarding if you read The Shining first.
"
"
  I re-read this after over 15 years probably since I last read it and I absolutely love the Kubrick flick but this book is by far better than either of the two movies made. I could never put it down.

  Stephen King wrote this book many years ago, however his writing technique and the suspense he so creatively wove into the story will endure the many advances in technology and changes in the people of the World.  Stephen King can artistically capture the basic emotions and capitalize on the innate, gut-level, fears and basic superstitions of all mankind.  Shining is an exce  llent example of the music of fear orchestrated by an outstanding conductor of horror, Mr Stephen King.
"
"
  My first Stephen King book that I finally decided to read years after first seeing The Shining film. I actually quite like the book at first because it offered a lot more back story and it was a real interesting read. That being said, When I got to the final 100 pages, I couldn't wait for it to end. The book seemed to just drag on and on and never seemed to finish. I think King could have easily cut 20 or 30 of those last 100 pages and it would have made it a lot more enjoyable to read.So that's my biggest issue with The Shining, It just never seems to end. Over the course of it all, I went from liking it to being absolutely bored with it and counting down each page waiting for it to end. Not at all a bad book but it can be a massive bore-fest.
"
"
  after organizing my boyfriends book shelf. i ordered a couple Stephen King books that i know he didn't have. when this one  arrived (much sooner then expected) he says to me "" oh honey i have read this one already"" i was a little sad, till i seen the look of excitement all over his face. "" but i wanted to read it again before reading Doctor Sleep, its truly a great story and the two go together""
"
"
  Amazing movie and acting was superb for the most part. Shelley Duvall is a bit too goofy for my taste though and she appears a bit miscast particularly if you read the book in which the female character is a strong woman. Although the movie differed from the book in key parts, especially the ending, I do not think it detracted from the movie. This movie is definitely worth seeing. Jack Nicholson does a great job as main character Jack Torrance and the boy who played Danny was good as well. If you like the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book. I think this movie was recently remade but I have not seen it yet. Hard to beat this one though.
"
"
  I haven't read this book in years and recently decided to re read it. As usual King writes an amazingly thoughtful and suspenseful story using characters that are well meaning but flawed. It was well worth the revisit and my teenage daughter decided to read it and loved it as well. Experiencing Jack descend into madness is a great ride.
"
"
  I loved this book
"
"
  This was an excellent Stephen King book.  I grew up being very frightened of the Shining movie and finally thought to read the actual book.  I have to say, the book differs very wildly from the actual movie.  More so than any other book made into movie that I have watched.  And of course, true to form, the book was better than the movie!
"
"
  Saw the Jack Nicholson movie a dozen time but never read the book before now; why did I wait this long??  Amazon's Kindle edition is priced right: at two bucks you can scare yourself to death all over again and get insight into the characters that the movie could never portray.
"
"
  I am very glad that I chose this one to get introduced to the awesome Stephen King literature. This is one mind blowing thrilling horror drama exploring the father and son relationship in a strange way. The Stanley Kubrick movie is absolutely disgusting and doesn't deserve to be known as movie version of the book. Read it today to have an experience of a lifetime.
"
"
  I’d seen the movie four or five times but still really, really enjoyed this book!
"
"
  No need to explain.
"
"
  I've read this book when it first came out - I was just a teenager and it gave me the shivers, really creeped me out. This is the second time around I'm reading The Shining and it is still as good. I recommend reading it first before going into Dr. Sleep, which I will start in a few seconds. Happy shivers youall!
"
"
  Still one of the great American tales of emotional and financial greed, spiritual hauntings out of local history and personal imagination, and the horrors--and redemption--found inside and outside of marriage.
"
"
  Loved it years ago, and loved it again! I wanted to reread it before reading Dr Sleep, and so glad I did. I think the movie had replaced most of my book memories, and the book is sooooo much better.
"
"
  Can be slow at times but overall a great book. Decided to read it after enjoying the film so much. While it is very different in a lot of ways I think if you enjoyed the movie you'll love the book.
"
"
  I have seen the movie too many times to count, and read lots of Stephen King books, but after hearing that he is writing a new book with the youngster in it, I felt I had to read the Shining. It was insightful, as far as finding out the true real story, and almost better in some ways than the movie. I was glad for a few things that the book had that the movie didn't.
"
"
  Like Mr. King I absolutely hate Stanley Kubrick's film version of this book. Jack Nicholson was totally wrong for the lead because the central character slowly slips into madness. With Nicholson he's already there. The book is the story in it's purest form untouched by Hollywood.
"
"
  Dense and detailed journey, suspense-filled moments and character evolution that was extremely satisfying. I personally didn’t find it as terrifying as others have described but I find it endlessly vivid and interesting.
"
"
  After listening to this book, you may not want to stay in a hotel alone. This is a great novel. This could be considered a semi autobiographical book for King. He is notcrazy of course. This is a great book to listen to. I agree with King when he states that the movie did not do the book justice
"
"
  I am so glad I finally picked up this book. I've always found the movie fascinating but the book is a whole different animal. Jack, Wendy and Danny come so alive that it is a little hard to bear the way they became disconnected. I was thoroughly engulfed in every second of this story, and I will hold Danny and his spirit in my heart forever. Stunning writing by a literary titan - read this book!
"
"
  Bought this for my daughters birthday and she loved it !
"
"
  Already sat down to start reading it! The book is in good condition with minimal damage to its cover.
"
"
  I read Dr. Sleep before I read The Shining. I wrongly assumed that having seen the movie I wouldn't have a myriad of questions. The sequel was so interestingly and intricately woven together that I knew I had to read the original to fully understand Danny. I would encourage any reader of King or the genre of horror to read both books.
"
"
  Brilliant, of course. Scary and heart pounding! Such a better ending than the movie. That's to say if you liked the movie, you will LOVE the book.
"
"
  As described
"
"
  If anything it was more scary.  I read it during the Halloween season, and it was the perfect read.  I love King - I don't love all his books, but this was one of his finest.  Highly recommended.  If you saw the movie, like I did, you might find yourself transposing the movie characters into the book as you read it.  I did that, couldn't help it, and it seemed to work ok.
"
"
  The book was a good sequel that didn't rely heavily on The Shining. It had enough reference to be relevant but did not try too hard. I enjoyed it
"
"
  This book was awesome.  Aside from 'Salem's Lot, it's my favorite book that I've read by Stephen King.  It is genuinely terrifying; this book actually gave me nightmares. The characters are all well developed, and the hotel is so creepy and evil.  I love reading Stephen King books because I think he is such a talented writer.
"
"
  The book, and the movie are two complete different things. Had to read this for a class. Great book.
"
"
  Very different than the movie...very different indeed.  They are so different you can't compare the two.  After having read the book, I now wonder what a movie would be like that followed the book a little closer.  Wish I would have read this sooner.  I really enjoyed it and for me it was a quick read.  I simply couldn't put it down.  Love books like that.
"
"
  Had to re-read this one on my way to Colorado for vacation--very fitting! I wanted to re-read it before picking up Doctor Sleep. So glad that I did because the book is so much better than the movie. King is the master of suspense and the creepy crawly factor is very much alive in this one!
"
"
  Haven't read any stephen King titles in a while. The only books I have read by him were the Dark Tower books. I loved them so I decided to take a chance on another title. Having seen the movie, I was interested in the book. Great read!!!
"
"
  Good addition to my library
"
"
  Wow.  What a story.  I read Dr. Sleep so reading this book was a must.  No disappointment.  Read it in two days.
"
"
  Was a really good book
"
"
  Good book
"
"
  I may be jaded because I love the film (Kubrick version) so much, but I felt that this was just an average King novel.  I really didn't feel for the characters and thought that everything with the lawn animals was just too much.  If you are just getting into King I would suggest another of his works, especially if you are a big fan of the Kubrick film.
"
"
  Worlds better than the movie.  Jack’s slow dissent into murderous insanity is frighteningly believable.  I’ll never look at topiary the same way again.
"
"
  My gf wanted to read the book. Its ok
"
"
  great book. I loved it when I was younger and I bought this copy for my 15yr old daughter, she loves it too
"
"
  I really enjoyed this book.  Stephen King continues to impress me.  Being a fan of the movie version,  I thought I knew what I was in for. I was pleasantly surprised to see many things left out of the movie.
"
"
  Liked it alot and came as shown
"
"
  As described. Very fast shipping!
"
"
  This is one of my favorite Stephen King books. It has been a while since I read The Shining so I cannot remember if it is written in first or third person. I love all of Stephen Kings books and have been reading them almost as long as he has been writing them.
"
"
  Never read the book before but have seen the movie countless times and the book is so much better.  Reading this book makes Dr. Sleep a perfect sequel.
"
"
  You would think that years after King wrote this book, it would lose some of its original appeal. Not the case at all. I tried to read this book at night and found myself jumping at the slightest noise. Such a creepy book! This is my first Stephen King book and I enjoyed it very much! I highly recommend The Shining. The book is way better than the movie!!!
"
"
  Before reading the second book i felt i had to re-read this one!  It was as good the second time around. Looking forward to see what is going on with Danny!
"
"
  I'll have to admit there isn't much...if anything Stephen King has written that I didn't like.  His ability to make you feel you are experiencing what his characters are going through is a real talent.  If you want to read the best horror/terror book ever written read King's, ""IT.""  You won't be disappointed nor will you sleep peacefully either.
"
"
  Really good book. I’m not even a fan of the horror genre but Steven King is such a great writer I couldn’t put it down.
"
"
  This is the second time I read this book because I was going to read his new one, ""Doctor Sleep"" and wanted to re-read this one in preparation. I had forgotton some of the subtleties of the book and found it just as satisfying as when I first read it.
"
"
  Wonderfully written, suspenseful, and thought-provoking. Unlike the sequel, Dr. Sleep, which pales in comparison, this book is a study in a man fighting his demons and a young boy learning to live with his supernatural gift. If you've seen the movie, you'll find that the book is very different, but I think you can enjoy both.  King is at his best here.
"
"
  I'm an avid Stephen king fan and have read most of his work, so this one has come as a pleasant surprise. I don't know,how, I missed it before,why I've been so late, picking this one up........ Don't make the same mistake, if you've to choose one good novel from Stephen king, I think this is the one....
"
"
  Stephen King has done it again! This was another book that I couldn't put down. I can't wait to read the next book.
"
"
  Awesome book! One of my favorites
"
"
  The Shining is Stephen King's BEST thriller, in my opinion! I've read the book and seen the movie countless times! I wanted to add the digital version of the book to my Kindle HDX since it's my go-to thriller read!! If you've seen the movie, you must read the book!
"
"
  Good book overall and fair price. Was in good shape once it arrived.
"
"
  Love this book!
"
"
  Stephen King is a great storyteller. Been a fan for over 30 years.
"
"
  If you enjoy horror The Shinning is a must read. This book gives me the creeps in the best way. I love the slow burn.
"
"
  Absolutely fantastic book. Read it in less then a week I had a hard time putting it down. Nothing compared to the movie. Started read the sequel Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  This is not another book I never got around to reading but have seen the movie several times. It is different than the movie but much better I feel. I want to now is the movie again to see what was left out or added.
"
"
  New Stephen King does not hold a candle to his earlier work.  This is still scary upon my second reading.
"
"
  I've loved watching the Shining for years, but there were always things about it that confused me. I finally decided to read the book, and I loved it even more! The book fills in many things that are missing from the movie, and some parts are different. It is well worth the read, and I only regret that it took me so many years to get around to reading it.
"
"
  Isn't like the picture, so if youre a collector looking for authentic, this is not for you. Still great value hardcover with dust jacket.
"
"
  Daughter loves!
"
"
  A true must read for a Stephen King/ suspense fan. Far different from the movie in many aspects but in all the right ways, the Kubrick movie, while a deservingly renown horror master piece, pales in comparison to this truly satisfying read.
"
"
  Although I've read the book multiple times over the years, this will always be one of my favorite of Stephen King's books. I can't help getting involved in the lives of the characters as well as their problems. Even knowing how the end will play out, I find myself rooting for the protagonist until the last possible moment.
"
"
  I grew up knowing the story in The Shining from the Kubrick movie of the same title. I went in to this book with the preconceived image of the characters in my mind as I began to read, which I am very pleased to say that lasted for a short time.Kubrick got the story, edition and theme all wrong, no wonder Mr. King distanced himself as quickly as he could from the film. To those that enjoy the film, I would say ignore the bastardized movie, and enter this book prepared for an enjoyable moment of well-written story telling.
"
"
  As always, King delivers. I read this as a teenager, now nearly 20+ years later, it still terrifies me. King has a way of reaching into ones psyche and rip the underlying fears from ones mind, giving way to the imagination.
"
"
  One of my favorite books! Twists and turns.
"
"
  I really enjoyed all the suspense and insight into each character as the book went on. 100% would recommend reading this book.
"
"
  A fantastic ghost story to say the least. The story enters the mind of man who struggles between the bottle and the truth, to himself and his family, and inside the mind of a very gifted child, who lives with the blessing and curse of said gift. Reading requires occasionally searching between the lines, where you will come to your own conclusions to what is going on, instead of it being dictated to you, as some authors do. King is a master craftsman of storytelling, The Shining is no exception.
"
"
  So much better than the movie! Definitely recommend. A thrilling read and classic piece of American horror literature. I had to read it for my American Gothic class and it is now one of my favorites. Stephen King never disappoints.
"
"
  I haven't read this since it came out years ago. I wanted to re-read it before I read Doctor Sleep. I didn't remember some of the parts, so it was a good read. This novel was well written, kept my interest, and it was hard to put down. I always get absorbed in Stephen King 's novels; I love novels that I get so involved in. I look forward to starting the sequel.
"
"
  Gift for my daughter.  She loves it.
"
"
  This is one of those popularized works that is hard to read without imagining the characters created within Stanley Kubrick's reimagining of the Shining - assuming you've seen it, of course. In spite of having one's vision or version tainted, King's work stands on its own as vivid. His paintbrush for painting scenes always ends up relating characters to the East Coast but his vision of Colorado is a bold and beautiful one. And with that beauty, there is the suspected horror that comes with the package deal of a King novel. The characters in the Shining are well rounded, feasible and just a few degrees away from what real monsters are - drinking problems, anger issues, mental health deterioration and the real world cases of an idiomatic term for a claustrophobic reaction cabin fever and isolation. What makes this so horrific is the plausibility of these characters - those they gave you life and now want to take it away from you. This is worth a read - and it is read best by kindlelight in the dark.
"
"
  Took me awhile to post this, but not as long as Stephen King took to write part 2.  I originally read this book many years ago, but decided to re-read it again because I was getting part 2 (Doctor Sleep) for Christmas and wanted to have the Shining fresh in my mind when I read Doctor Sleep.It's Stephen King, if you like him then you probably already read this book and liked it.
"
"
  I thought the book was much better then the movie, which I watched for the first time in a very long time right after I finished the book. The hedge animals were a stretch though. Non the less, I would highly recommend this book, especially if you have never seen the movie to constantly compare it with!!!
"
"
  Awesome. Love Stephen King. One of those books you'll read more than once. Nice!
"
"
  It's The Shining!  Where can you go wrong?  I bought this to re-read before Doctor Sleep came out, and I was not disappointed.  As great as I remembered, and it's always nice to have Stephen King on my kindle.  The book is well formatted and does not have some of the ""weird"" issues I've found in some rescanned kindle books.  A great copy of The Shining.
"
"
  Great book
"
"
  The shining is great and I feel a must read when you are making that jump from Young Adult fiction to Adult. It is also a good book to start on when you are ready to plunge into Steven King's world. I followed this book up with Doctor Sleep, which takes place years after as Danny is an adult. Loved them both
"
"
  Purchased this for my girlfriend's Stephen King collection. It's a simple paperback.
"
"
  Hands down one of the most compelling books I've read in a while. Even though I knew how it would end (who hasn't seen the movie?), I could not put this novel down. After reading it, you realize how packed full of suspense and horror the book is. The movie (like most movies written from books) only skims the surface. I personally loved the in-depth character development of Danny, Wendy, Jack, and Dick Hollorann.
"
"
  I finally read this book. It is sooo good! It has so many eerie moments that gave me goosebumps. I can only find time to read before bed, so you can imagine how those nights were for me. I had the feeling that someone was watching!The characters are impossible not to love. Danny is sweet, and very kept to himself. He understands way too much for such a young kid, and you can't help but feel sorry for him and this gift he has, which in that Hotel is a curse. He was so well crafted with this mix of maturity and innocence. He is perfect!Jack Torrance is a troubled man who is trying to put his life back together. But he is sincere in his efforts and loves his family, especially Danny. You can tell he is doing his best. He had so many quirks it brought him alive, and you can see how he slowly begins to give in to The Overlook (the Hotel). It is a very subtle process. His character development is the strongest. I think Mr. King created this character brilliantly!I felt so much empathy for Wendy she is also a rather distressed woman, who is trying to do what's best for her family. She is sweet, and attentive, and her biggest concern is her child. She does have an opinion of her own regarding what is best for Danny. She is a very present mother. I loved that she believed in Danny's abilities since the beginning, and that she wasn't scared of confronting her husband. She isn't the strongest woman, I'll give you that, but considering all she's been through, she came out as such a flawed and real woman. I loved her.Finally, the Overlook is a character of its own. You cannot tell at first, but as things start to happen, you sort of guess it. It has a mind of its own, and a personal agenda, which is in fact the scariest thing about the book.Overall, the book is one of the best I've read ever! Seriously Mr. King you lived up to your name.
"
"
  I love <U+0001F498>this book . One of my faves. Came in fast. Was what I expected. Came in perfect condition
"
"
  I knew this was a classic and now I can see why. Even knowing the ending, I was still riveted. There were so many instances of good writing that I felt like I was constantly underlining! Loved it! Great to read during Halloween!
"
"
  my favorite
"
"
  I got through the book but it lagged in many places.
"
"
  Stephen King's novels are amazing, in spite of the various cheesy movies they have been made into, because of his ability to pull us into the minds of his characters. Jack Torrance is not a scary man because he is evil; he is frightening precisely because he wants so badly to be a good husband and father.The Shining is a terrifying descent into madness, and the futile attempts to escape it.
"
"
  Is it possible to love the movie and love the book? (They're completely different.) Yes. They both work very very very well. The Kubrick adaptation is a completely different story, so if you have only seen the movie, you owe it to yourself to discover King's original vision. You will love it too.
"
"
  It was fun to read the book after seeing the movie so long ago. I even re-watched the movie and was disappointed that so much of the book was missing.I didn't rate it 5 starts because some parts seemed to drag, like King was rambling on so I skimmed them.It was still a book it didn't want to put down.
"
"
  Great book, super consuming to read during a quarantine
"
"
  Great validation that satan really does exist.

  I'm really glad I read this book. It was on sale and, being very familiar with the movie, I was interesting in reading the book. I really enjoyed it. Unlike some of his other books (i.e. The Mist), this isn't terribly scary - it's more of a Twilight Zone creepy than anything. Overall, I good read.
"
"
  If you've seen the movie but never read the book, like I had, you just don't know.... Saw the movie many times, then read the new Dr. Sleep (little Danny Torrance all grown up) and took King's advice (read The Shining if you only saw the movie). I had no idea how much they left out of the film. A must read for any horror fan!
"
"
  I read this several years ago for the first time and was impressed by the slow progression and digression into madness by Jack. After seeing the Kubrick film and read the book again in anticipation of Doctor Sleep, I was just as enthralled by this book and actually found the film less terrifying by comparison. Unmask!!
"
"
  This book was a page turner. I kept reading chapter after chapter wanting to know what would happen next. All of the characters were so interesting, and the detail was perfect. I could picture all of the characters and the surroundings so well. The only reason I am giving it four stars is because I anticipated it to be a little scarier and much of the book was lacking action. Still a great read that I would definitely recommend.
"
"
  A Stephen King Classic. This novel, like many of Kings' works, plumbs the nature of human frailty. The Characters therein show readers both the abysmal lows we humans can sink, but also the visceral power of a parents' love. A great study of the human condition.
"
"
  Such a wonderful book. I only watched the movie by Kubrick and while that was a masterful film, this book really delves deeper into the Overlook Hotel. Also it tells a different message altogether.
"
"
  Very Good!

  This past summer we visited the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park Colorado the setting for the book the shining. I was never able to watch the movie because I have such terrible nightmares. I wanted to know the story however so I decided to read the book after visiting the hotel. Stephen King is certainly a master of suspense and building horrific situations. This book is almost impossible to put down because he keeps his foot on the throttle ratcheting up the fear and tension with nearly every page. The characters are strong and you want desperately for the ending to be happy but you know ultimately that something terrible will happen . I have read many of King's stories over the years, but this is probably the one I will remember the most due to the terrific job he does of building the tension. You must remember that King writes stories from his own fears and many of the scenes in this book are things all of us have had as our own irrational fears. Things like opening the shower curtain and someone being there, the weird spooky sounds at night in an unfamiliar place, the horror of losing your mind and knowing it.  Definitely one of the horror master's finest. Don't read it alone after dark.
"
"
  Good book
"
"
  very scary. Don't read it at night or alone. Read it during the day with a lot of people around. If you like scary this is the book for you.
"
"
  Somehow I got a defect and this book starts on page 21 (end of Chapter 2 - beginning of Chapter 3! <U+0001F61F><U+0001F621>
"
"
  The story line kept me intrigued the enter time. I hadn't seen the movie before I read it so I came in with a blank slate. It was freaky scary sometimes, but not to the extent I thought I would be scared. Overall I enjoyed the book from start to finish.
"
"
  I enjoyed reading The Shining. It helped me to understand the movie better, even though the movie was only based on the book. I still enjoy the movie but I really enjoyed book. I had a difficult time putting the book down once I got to the middle of the story. It was my first Steven King book and now I'm hooked. Can't wait to start on another book of his.
"
"
  MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE. Beautiful writing ability! Don’t watch the movie. It’s terrible.
"
"
  I reread this in anticipation of reading Dr. Sleep.  I didn't want to forget any details he might reference.  I'm glad I did because there were references and, one in particular, I would've forgotten.This book also reminded me how brilliant Stephen King CAN be and how truly scary he is at times.
"
"
  Wonderfully constructed psychological analysis of a descent into madness with a little help from 'the other side'!Stephen King said,when asked about the Stanley Kubrick adaptation of his book,it was one I ""...remember hating"". Read this book and you will realize that Stephen was being overly kind! The movie was an absolute travesty and totally miscast.
"
"
  A masterpiece of scary.
"
"
  It is very hard to block out the movie scenes that are SO memorable and in my opinion iconic in nature, but it is worth it to read the book. Stephen King was very displeased with the movie and thought that it did not represent the book well - that in itself was motivation to read the book.I wanted to renew the story before Dr. Sleep came out and I am so glad I did. It gives a new definition of scary. This is the raw, real kind of scary where you will check under your (hotel) bed at night.
"
"
  sister loves his work
"
"
  I've seen the movie about a hundred times.  Great movie.  King has a style that must be read to be understood.  There are too many nuances and images in his books to put into films.  Your mind has to be the theater.  I bought this book on my Kindle so that I could read 'Doctor Sleep' in earnest.  Can't wait.  FYI,  read 'Christine' if you really want to be scared and, in my opinion, '11/22/64' is the best Stephen King book out there.  It's about a thousand pages but well worth the read.
"
"
  If you are a fan of the movie, you will love the book. 660 pages, but most intriguing.
"
"
  I really enjoyed finally reading this book. All I had ever seen was the movie and I can tell you that there are some significant differences between the two.On the up side, King has written a sequel to The Shining, called Doctor Sleep. I read that last week and it was excellent!
"
"
  If you liked the movie this is a must read. Definitely gets more into character development and understanding of their motivations.
"
"
  Wow so good as I read I could see it playing out in my head have not yet see the mover but like always the mover has a lot to live up to
"
"
  Finally read the book after being a huge fan of the movie. As per usual, the details and depth of the book far surpasses anything the movie presented. Both still great but the read is so worth it! Halloran!
"
"
  one of the must read!
"
"
  Classic for a reason
"
"
  Up until now I had only seen the Movie...should have read the book first. A very Excellent novel by King and I highly recommend you read it even if you already seen the movie as it is much different and more understandable..PICKI IT UP!!!!
"
"
  We're up for an alcoholic laughingstock in the King's house!Seriously, one of my favorite King books. If you read any Stephen King ever---and you can only pick one book....read this one.
"
"
  I love the way Stephen King gets into everyone's head. You are able to watch the effect of the Overlook on each character as time passes and the isolation becomes more and more suffocating. Some parts read slower than others but when the pace picked up, for me, it really picked up.
"
"
  Even though this is an older book, I never saw the movie and finally had the opportunity to read this book. Like so many other of his books it was excellent reading once again
"
"
  Great classic as always!
"
"
  All I can say is just meh.  I love the Kubrick film, so I really enjoy the story! But Stephen King as a writer to me is way over rated.  He's got great ideas, but some how manages to find the most boring and dull way to write about it.  I wasn't scared or nervous... even excited.... just mostly bored.The enjoyment I did get was more back story on the characters as well as the Overlook and comparing the book to both of the film versions.
"
"
  This is my second full read of this book, the first having been years and years ago. It's just as good as I remembered. Stephen King has a fantastic gift for exploring humanity itself through tales of make-believe monsters and that's always what stays with me the longest after reading his stories. Now I've gone right into re-reading the sequel, Doctor Sleep, because I just wasn't quite ready to let Danny go.
"
"
  YES! YES! YES! BABIES!
"
"
  A page turner, but I shouldn’t have to tell anyone that; just look at the name of the author above the title of the book.
"
"
  The book,as always, was better than the movie. As I read the book, I kept thinking about how Jack Nicholson was the perfect choice for the movie. The movie scared the heck outta me, but the book scared me more that I could not read it at night  :)
"
"
  King at his finest. Dark, haunting, and beautiful, just like The Overlook itself. Wonderfully paced and masterfully written. Do yourself a favor and read The Shining!
"
"
  Read it back in High School and it quickly became one of my top 3 favorite Stephen King books next to IT and Cujo. Since most of his books have gone down a tad bit in quality after Revival it is definitely a worthwhile read.
"
"
  I read this a long time ago when it first came out and loved it.  But, when Dr. Sleep came out I decided to re-read this and it was a lot scarier than I had remembered.  Loved it just as much as the first time I read it.  I highly recommend re-reading this (or reading it for the first time) before reading Dr. Sleep.  Wonderful writing as usual for Mr. King.
"
"
  No
"
"
  Suspense and many moments of panic as you read how one man slowly becomes part of the house's mysteries. I have only seen part of the movie of the same name and will have to see it all. The book is so intricate I wonder how a movie could do it justice. If you love suspense and fear read it.
"
"
  Great price for Stephen King.
"
"
  It's a classic! I love the book and the movie, which are two completely different stories. King really gives depth to Jack's turning, where as the movie seems to have Jack just snap into bad guy overnight.
"
"
  Super well written but I was crazy bored every time I finished reading the parts that were chilling. I thought the book would be better because the movie was also boring.
"
"
  This book is so well thought out and detailed, giving just enough of a hint of things to come. Whether having seen the movie or not, you can tell that something big is building in the background and he gives small teasing looks into it throughout the story.
"
"
  I have been a Steven King fan for a long time.  This was not close to his best.  Do not understand how this made him famous.  It was really a slow read and predictable.  I saw the movie many years ago and did not hook up with it relative to this book. But still a fan and look forward to more Steven King in the future.
"
"
  One of Stephen King's best. As a reader you will not be disappointed in this book.
"
"
  Solid horror/thriller, easy read and was a great introduction to King and the genre for me. Looking forward to more.
"
"
  I was surprised at some of the differences between the book and the movie. Book is incredibly better than movie.
"
"
  I absolutely loved this book!  So far the best Steven King book I've read. I already want to read it again. I've read a lot of horror books but this one really gave me the chills! If u like a scary page turner u need to read this book.
"
"
  A lot of differences from the movie and I actually like a lot of the changes used in the film adaptation. Usually not the case.
"
"
  This book has to be one of my new favorites! It catches your attention immediately and it doesn't let go until the very end. None of the story was predictable. It was quite suspenseful and chilling all throughout the story. Better than any horror movie, for sure!
"
"
  MUST READ

"
  Five stars for the horror book spanning Generations of readers and terrifying millions of people still to come thank you Stephen King

  This was a very thrilling novel. Full of twists and turns to keep you guessing. If you love thrillers and horror this is the book for you!April MargesonInternational Bestselling AuthorEternity (Circle of Light)Chaos (to be released from Cresco Books 10/23/14)
"
"
  I went in wanting horror, thrill, and possibly even suspense. I left feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. I’ve heard the movie is better.
"
"
  You think it’s like the movie? Think again. Even better. Didn’t think the book could have me this anxious and scared.
"
"
  I read this book as a kid and decided to reread it before reading dr skeep.  Still husr as scary as when i was a kid. I found myself readung on my breaks and lunches and huerying home to get settled and read with dinner. King ar his finest
"
"
  Amazing book! Very similar to the movie yet extremely different!  I love it
"
"
  classic great condition
"
"
  I hadn't read much classic King before this book, but it was so good. Creepy in all the right ways and flowed well. I really liked it.
"
"
  Well written book
"
"
  So good. Read the sequel straight after to get the full effect.  I  couldn't wait to get to the end.
"
"
  A haunted hotel and just wow. It's a great read, full of many moments. I'm sure most people have seen the movie and/or miniseries, this is way different.
"
"
  If you have seen the movie, and decided not to read the book....rethink that.  I am not taking anything away from the movie, but the book is much much better.  More character development, different ending, oh, and much, much better ""bushes"".
"
"
  This is one of the best books I have ever read, I love being so enthralled in a book to were I have to finish it or if I put it down for a breather ( to give my brain and eyes a rest) I have to pick it up later on. Stephen King is one of the best writers of all time, give it a read you won't be disappointed.
"
"
  If a book keeps me up past bed time because I cannot put it down its worth 4 stars. If you want to read it all day and work gets in the way of finishing it. Well then it's a 5 for me. Movie couldn't do it justice, but this will be a book I read over and over again.
"
"
  It's been many years since I've seen the movie ""The Shining"". So I thought it would be a great idea for me to read the book before watching it again. WONDERFUL IDEA !  Also I never realized there was a second book !  Time to read ""Dr. Sleep"" !!
"
"
  I read this again before reading Dr.Sleep.and I highly recommend doing this. The old and the new meld together extremely well and complement each other. If anyone can write a sequel, just take a look at Dark Tower if you have any doubts.
"
"
  Great book great price
"
"
  the best part of Stephen King novels is how they create a movie in your head because they are so full of description and well rounded character. Just read it.  So much better than the movie.
"
"
  Great read
"
"
  Remake of the movie should be made to capture all the thrills, ups and downs of this brilliant masterpiece! The movieDid no justice to the book at all. Fake pieces, and a different ending...no, it needs to be told as it is in the book!
"
"
  I downloaded the sample of Dr. Sleep, having only watched the movie version of The Shining, and on the very first page I new I would have to go back to where the story of Danny Torrence started if I was going to read Dr. Sleep.  Many people say ""the book was so much better"" and that line can be no truer for The Shining.Immediately, the characters elicit strong emotions from the reader.Jack Torrence, both protagonist and antagonist, compells the reader to feel sympathetic for his plight.  As a ""dry drunk"" who has fallen on hard times after a short bit of success as a writer, he is desperate to straighten out his life for his family and feels that his last chance to do so is to take the caretaker job at the Overlook Hotel during the winter season.  The reader can relate to this desire to provide for one's family.  Jack's indecision - to stay at the Hotel and guarantee financial support or to leave the Hotel for the safety of his son - is very palpable.  Jack's desire to be a good father plucks at the reader's heartstrings.Wendy, Jack's wife, was not as likeable as her husband, in my opinion.  She is very timid, having suffered her mother's psychological and mental abuse for years.  It's obvious that she has traded her mother's abuse for Jack's quick temper and (at times) violent outbursts.  She is only strong enough to stand up to Jack when their son's safety is concerned.  Any other time, she dances around the issues that have plagued her marriage and is outright skittish whenever Jack's mood sours.  I felt that her inability to stand up for herself made her unlikeable.Danny, the five-year-old boy of the Torrence clan, was by far the most interesting character.  He is very gifted with psychic abilities such as telepathy, empathy, precognition, and mediumship.  As a child, he has very little understanding of these abilities and of the adult subject matter that he is inadvertently subjected to due to his abilities.  This struggle is captured very well as it is described through his young and innocent point of view.  The reader feels afraid for him as his abilities draw the attention of the malevolent spirits dwelling in the Overlook Hotel.King does an amazing job bringing his characters to life.  The reader is captivated by the Torrence family chemistry via an in-depth look into their histories, their lifes' experiences, and their struggles.  These elements become crucial to the events that transpire inside the Overlook Hotel and they become fuel for the spirits that are preying upon the Torrence family, thus entwining events of the past with those of the present.As always, Kind does an excellent job with description.  Not only can the reader visualize the Hotel's various locations (the lobby, kitchen, different floors, the basement, the outdoors) but he also does an amazing job capturing the emotions and thoughts of the main characters.  The reader knows what the characters are experiencing, knows what they are feeling, knows what they are hoping to accomplish.The story moves along at a very steady pace.  Told through a limited third person point of view, the present is interspersed with tidbits from each characters' pasts that bring relevancy to the current situation.  As tension between family members rise and as the danger of the hotel becomes more evident, the pace steadily grows faster and faster, making it very difficult to put the book down.The Shining was a very enjoyable book, full of human emotion and supernatural phenomena.  With characters that are compelling and well-rounded and a story that captivates, this is a book that I highly recommend.
"
"
  I decided to do a reread this before moving on to King's sequel.  I had forgotten the differences between the book and the movie, and although actor Jack's role is now classic, I actually prefer the book.  Mr. King is a brilliant storyteller!
"
"
  What can I say this book is amazing! It’s a classic and I’m just getting around to it but I’ve gotten through most of it in about a week. Stephen King novels are the best of the best.
"
"
  Steven King is a great writer and very few of books make great movies. His depth and detail of characters makes it hard for them to be translated on the big screen. The shining is an exception to this rule and was a good movie but the book showed so much more to the characters. You can never fully get the stories of King without reading the books and that is why  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves King or the move the Shining.
"
"
  I love the way Stephen King introduces his characters, letting us know from the very first that terror is on the way. His foreshadowing is brilliant. All the characters are motivated to let themselves be caught in an impossible and frightening locale. This is Stephen King at his finest.
"
"
  I was blown away how different the Movie is from the book, I can see why King doesn't care for the movie. Honestly I think both stories are really good and they should be enjoyed separately.
"
"
  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt King tried to make Jack Torrence sympathetic, but I mostly felt it was too pushed. I know part of it was how we were supposed to see how Jack thought he deserved sympathy even if he didn't, - and those scenes worked - but overall he irritated me to a certain degree. Maybe that's what King was going for?
"
"
  I first read the Shining over 30 years ago when I first started my Stephen King obsession.  When I heard about the sequel coming out, I decided to skim through the Shining again just to refresh my memory.  To my surprise and pleasure, I couldn't put it down.  Not only did I read every word, but it was just as scary and suspenseful!  Can't wait to read the sequel!!
"
"
  I originally read the Stand many years ago.  It is one of the few Stephen King books I reread every so often.  Was concerned that the additional material would take away from the story.  Nope!  I read ever word (something I usually don't do with S. King novels); enthralling from the very beginning.  Hated to see it end.
"
"
  Just what I wanted.
"
"
  I enjoyed everything about this book! The whole story is interesting, I felt like I just couldn't stop reading! Very thrilling, the imagery throughout the whole book is so incredible and so detailed, I was highly satisfied reading the shining. It deserves five stars, hands down! Well worth reading!
"
"
  Stephen King is a great author and this novel is no exception. I grew up having seen the movie several times but had never read the book until just recently and wow, I can't even watch the movie ever again, it does not do the story justice. The creepiness of the hotel and its inhabitants activies left me shivering, especially as the hotel began to come alive. The ending was great, specifically the confrontation between Danny and his dad (the hotel/ghost).
"
"
  Very belated read of this King classic but worth the wait. Like most my only previous association with this dark tale is the 70's movie of the same name which I greatly enjoyed but the original book is on a whole new level. Chilling, exciting and captivating - get yourself a copy today.
"
"
  Great book.
"
"
  This book is great and obviously goes into a lot more depth than the movie. Lots of scares, surprises and a satisfying ending!
"
"
  I have read a number of his books over the years, and discovered I had some how missed this.  It was like finding a Christmas present that you forgot to open.
"
"
  I love the book but it came damaged with pages wrinkled and the cover folder as well.  Wasn't too pleased when I opened the box, and it certainly was not the first time this has happened.
"
"
  Big Stephen King fan and loved this one!
"
"
  Anyone who thinks they can watch this movie and skip the book, they are out of their minds! This book is out if this world amazing compared to the movie- which is still a classic obviously, but still doesn't compare to an original writing by Stephen King. Read this one before Doctor Sleep, you won't regret it!
"
"
  This book was my one of my dad's favorite books...I myself have seen the movie before reading the book and realized that the book had quite a bit of differences than the movie. SO I  then decided to read the book also. After reading it I realized that if the movie followed the book word for word then the movie would have been 10 times better than it already is!!!
"
"
  A good Stephen King I guess but not terribly horrifying. A bit too much ghost activity for my liking; it may have made a better movie than a book.  It seemed contrived and I found myself not believing it. It also went on too long and became quite boring in spots.
"
"
  This was my first Stephen King book and though it was a good read, I did at times find it hard to continue reading. Just didn't grasp my attention as other novels do.  Better than the movie yes, I'd say.  My only complaint is the racism apparent throughout. Not sure why the author found it necessary to include that.
"
"
  Haven’t read it yet but it came fast and it’s a new book as expected.
"
"
  Perfect!
"
"
  Glad I read this book but it is fairly different from the movie. I like the books ending better though.
"
"
  An absolute classic masterpiece told by one of the greatest writers of this century. Beautifully written horror that will always the scary.
"
"
  Wonderful book..a must read
"
"
  Exceptional and creative writing. King is the master of creating evil. This is the most exciting, suspense full novel I have ever read I particularly enjoyed his descriptive throughout this book.Writers should  read this before starting on their own project.
"
"
  Great book! King has a gorgeous way of writing that just really brings the world to you. Very creepy and exciting!
"
"
  Since Amazon is requiring me to say a little about this book, I will tell you that it is a compelling read and different enough from the original movie to keep your interest/suspense.
"
"
  The Shining is a classic find to read because of the suspense it carries through each page you read. It's a very left on the edge of your seat tension and will leave you wanting more.
"
"
  This is one of Mr. Kings earliest works. It is outstanding. Keeps one on the edge of ones seat the whole time. I decided to read it because I knew the movie version with Jack Nicholson was a big success; however I also knew that was not the story that Mr. King wanted to tell. I wanted to hear what he had to say about substance abuse in general and alcoholism in particular. Needless to say, he feels it's a nightmare. Having grown up in an alcoholic home, I can attest that he's quite accurate.  Can't wait to read Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  It has been a while since I finished a book, and this book wouldn't let me put it down. Although probably unsuitable for younger children (violence and sexual dialogue and situations), someone 15+ would enjoy this book. It has earned a place among my favorites.
"
"
  This is one of King's earlier works and his writing is tight and pointed constantly on the story line.  The movie did not do justice to the themes and character development in the book and though a great fan of Kubrick, he missed the mark.  Read the book, you'll be much more satisfied.
"
"
  Next time I'll read the review on Travelocity!
"
"
  What an amazing author. The way King describes even the simplest of things is majestic. You find yourself in the head of each main character and King makes it easy to travel from one mind/thought to the next. The Shining is a remarkable story, full of wonder, suspense and terror.
"
"
  It was ok...not really scary or horrifying, but actually kind of vulgar. And he's pretty loose with the n word. I prefer the Kubrick movie.
"
"
  Good read but not as scary as people make it out to be. Still will recommend as it is a good story.
"
"
  I've read this novel about four times since it was first published. And every time I do, I still have to keep the light on at night. This novel of S.King's ranks as one of his best, right alongside Salem's Lot. The ebook version is compatible with my Kindle Fire. A definite keeper.
"
"
  Great book. Different from the movie.
"
"
  I read this book ages ago, but needed to reread it after buying Doctor Sleep, the sequel.
"
"
  I read this book thirty or so many years ago. I just finished dr sleep and thought I should re-read this book. What awesome fun it was to be scared again. I am going to re-read Dr. sleep,and the Stand, and ... Well you get the idea
"
"
  As I'm sure it's been said a thousand times, the book and the film are two completely distinct creatures. The book is about a hotel and a family, but it's also about the pain caused by generational cycles of abuse and addiction--and about fathers and sons. I love the Kubrick film for what it is, but the book has so much more heart and so many more dimensions to it. Glad I finally decided to read it after all these years.
"
"
  After reviewing a nice little Swiss thriller set in a Swiss mountain resort (Deal with the Devil), I thought I might visit the mother of all mountain resort horror stories, and pay a tribute to the king of popular literature. The man knows his craft. I have not read much by him, previously only Carrie, which is a small first novel, but a good basis for a strong movie, and Lisa's Story, at the time his latest publication, which I liked a lot, but which disappointed the fan club.My main encounters with SK happen through the many movies made after his many stories. The Shining was one of the best of those movies, though it appears from SK's introduction to this 2001 reprint that he had some reservations about Kubrick's version. I ought to watch it again. I have a faint recollection that I found Jack Nicholson's acting overdone, long time ago.The novel is a marvel of efficient storytelling. SK says it was his 'crossroad' novel. At that time, i.e. the early 70s, he decided to branch out from the pure horror approach and weave in a 'real' theme, which is the story of a troubled man and his struggles against his worldly demons: alcohol and violence. The hero Jack, best known with Nicholson's face, has a tendency to 'lose his temper'. In the process he loses his teaching job and his home and nearly loses his family. The road downhill leads up to a Colorado mountain, where he gets hired as a winter caretaker in a monster of a hotel, the Outlook. SK prepares us for all kinds of horrors: ghosts of dead hotel guests, a malfunctioning and possibly dangerous heating and plumbing system, the prospects of being snowed in for a long time, a predecessor who couldn't take it and killed his wife and daughters, a little son with supernatural abilities who can read his father's mind and can see the word 'suicide' there, which he does not understand ... Enough for today. Go and read it, if only in the interest of a balanced diet.
"
"
  Amazing book !!
"
"
  Great book.
"
"
  Stephen King's The Shining still gives me shivers to this very day! The book is of course better than the movie, so I cannot recommend it highly enough for those avid King book collectors. Mr. King NEVER disappoints me! I love this book!
"
"
  Phenomenal!  I grew up reading Stephen King, but this was one I hadn't read until recently.  I suppose it's because I saw the movie, and didn't feel the need to re-visit the story.  After hearing in recent media Stephen King's utter disdain for what is one of my favorite films, I decided to read the book to weigh in for myself.  I took the book along on our family vacation to Mexico and stayed up most nights reading, in the dark, the only light coming from my son's skull book light clip (he's a huge R.L.Stine fan).  This book terrified me.  I was often too scared to read more than a few pages at a time in the dark, and had to read during the day on the beach.  Pretty silly for a grown woman, I know!  Stephen King is a master of making his readers feel intimate to his books' characters.  The imagery that came from reading this terrifying story is much more frightening than even those creepy twins and elevators spilling blood that Stanley Kubrick produced.  Seriously, if you haven't read Stephen King's The Shining, it's a MUST for any SK fan.  Can't wait to read Doctor Sleep...

  After reading the book for the first time I didn't quite understand how it was made into a movie. I actually think the movie is alot better.
"
"
  This was my first Stephen King novel, and boy, did I like it! I thought it was extremely well-written, and it was quite thrilling. It was scary and disturbing - so much so that I actually couldn't read it while I was at home alone :-/
"
"
  As far as Stephen King novels go, this is one of his best. A classic story. The slow build and tension were a great part of the story and kept me hooked until the last page.
"
"
  King's fast-paced psycho thriller remains highly enjoyable even after being 30+ years old! I had seen the Kubrick movie and had always wanted to read the book. As is typical of King's characters, you get so much more backstory in the books than is in any way possible in a movie, not to mention the fact that Kubrick took the story in a very different direction in his movie. Would highly recommend for King fans and for those readers who would liketo know more about why Jack Torrance is who he is and learn more about the Stanley Hotel itself.
"
"
  Finally read it. I liked it as much as the movie.
"
"
  Very good book! And the conditions it was in when I finally received it was great, super clean no scratches tears, folds or anything good job Amazon!
"
"
  It was a Christmas gift!
"
"
  Scares the poo out of me book and original movie.  I can not even watch that old movie anymore it causes nightmares and I am not easliy scared.  Those two little girls  holding hands --- shiver.  Redrum --- shiver..... READ THIS ONE!  My second favorite King novel with The Stand being #1.
"
"
  gave as a gift
"
"
  obviously 5 stars... It's freaking Stephen King
"
"
  I was amazed at painful the descriptions of the main character were: how tortured he was, the nuances of his interactions with his wife, etc. it was wrenching for me to read the psychological parts of the book: the horror parts were almost ancillary.
"
"
  I really like this book! It makes so much sense! I watched the movie first and had a lot of questions, this book is amazing!
"
"
  Great book. I've never seen the movie. But I want to. It really caught my interest. I loved it.
"
"
  This was so good
"
"
  You get to know your characters so well throughout they come alive word for word with strong feeling and emotion. If you want a great read I highly recommend this as it was recommended to me!
"
"
  This book was absolutely terrifying. It has become my favourite King without a doubt. The way you get into the characters heads is a testament to Kings excellent writing. 10/10
"
"
  Not one of Stephen kings best books it was ok I just wasn't really into it
"
"
  I didn't read the book when Stephen King published it, I just went to the movie. But If you read his sequel, Doctor Sleep, then you are going to need to read the Shining. I read it and was in awe with the story. The movie was great, the book is better. The two are different.
"
"
  I'm a big king fan and a HUGE movie fan. And although the movie was great, the book was better!! I'd love to see this made into a movie page for page. Very different ending than the movie, better I think. Great read!!
"
"
  Honestly, I can't remember a book of King 's that I didn't love, that didn't keep me up until the wee hours of the morning, gripped by prose that I couldn't put down until it was finished with me.The Shining is no different.
"
"
  Very good novel, much better than the movie. It is not only about fear, demons. It is also about family life, child beating, guilt and many more. Simple language is a huge advantage for English learners.
"
"
  Do not read this book in the dark! Stephen King is certainly the master of terrifying suspense. I DO NOT recommend this book to anyone who has an over-active imagination. However, if you are (or you think you are) brave enough to read this book, you will find it to be a suspenseful page turner =0)
"
"
  Read this book when it first came out and it scared me silly!  I'm enjoying re-reading it, but it doesn't have the same initial impact.  Nonetheless it is a great book!  The movie doesn't do it justice so skip that!
"
"
  Finished in 2 days. Very capturing and thrilling. Can’t wait to read the sequel. Very interesting story that kept me at attention the whole time.
"
"
  I typically enjoy reading Stephen King, but I've admittedly focused on reading his more recent works since so many of his older works have been made into movies.  The Shining is one that I had never even considered reading, however it was the October (Halloween) selection for my book club.  I was pleased that the book club chose a horror selection for Halloween, so I decided that it was a great time for me to try out an older King novel.Despite being almost 700 pages I feel that The Shining was a relatively quick and easy read.  The book is filled with descriptive text, but I feel that is an important aspect of King's works.  The amount of detail made it easier for me to visualize the characters and the worlds (physical and psychological) that they were residing in.  There were times that the suspense made it hard to step away from reading!Now the reason why I gave this book 4/5 stars...the book wasn't really that scary and despite the high level of detail there were times, especially toward the end, that the writing felt rushed.  There were parts of the book that were somewhat frightening, especially if you consider the fact that we all have inner demons of some sort.  However, it's not a book that I would be afraid to read before bed.  To me it seemed like there was a lot of buildup to the final climax, but then the climax itself was somewhat disappointing.  I expected a little more conflict than what actually occurred.
"
"
  I know this book is old, but I have never read it.  Since I am running out of Stephen King books to read, I decided to read this one that I have apparently never read!  I am about 69% through and I can't put it down.  One of his best writings!  I would highly recommend reading this one!
"
"
  Normally I don't read Stephen King or much horror in general, but this book really caught my attention, an after all it's almost Halloween. I really enjoyed it and thought it was surprisingly well written as well as fun to read. Scary but also suspenseful and with characters who keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more. I understand now why King decided to write a sequel. You really do want to know what happened to Danny years later.
"
"
  I bought this as a gift for a past girlfriend as a gift it was one of her favorite movies. I didn't read this novel but I have read others. he is such a great writer I'm sure it's Awesome. She probably never opened it.lol
"
"
  I read this when it first came out and wanted to reread it before reading Doctor Sleep. Only King would wait 36 years to write a sequel. It was just as good the second time around. No wonder I have followed him for so many years.
"
"
  My problem is comparing it to the movie, and knowing the outcome. Somewhat anyway, as there were quite a few differences. At any rate, it may have been a 5 star if I didn't have that comparison.  Was glad I read the book though, the book always seems to be better.
"
"
  The Shining is the second novel by Stephen King that I've read. After reading IT, I was curious to see if I would achieve that creepy supernatural high again. Not as strong as IT (probably the greatest novel I have ever read) but it was there, and I was satisfied.
"
"
  Great book and definitely suspenseful
"
"
  Stephen King never disappoints,I just loved this book,a quick mover with a killer story line...after all these years of writing Mr. King only gets better and better with age....keep 'me coming Steve,you are the best!
"
"
  One of my favorite Stephen king novels!
"
"
  Good way to pass the time.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let you go.  Keeps you going at every turn.
"
"
  Great book! I definitely recommend it. Stephen King told this story in such a way that you feel like you are in the hotel with them.
"
"
  Was looking for a full sized hardcover. Seller failed to mention was a bookclub half sized edition.
"
"
  This was hard to read.  It's so sad and frightening to see a family fall to pieces in the worst of ways through a child's fear. Danny is like Leo in The Stand, somewhat telepathic, and I can't decide if that makes it worse for him because of everything going on in his parents head that he does (and the vicious things he doesn't) understand or better because he has a mild influence. Before anything supernatural or bloody this is already a haunting family drama.  The Overlook and its dark menagerie come alive in the second half of the book as a malevolent Wonderland and the last twenty percent is a violent race to the finish.  Kubrick's famous typewriter scene is not in the book and neither are the ghosts of Grady's twin girls, scenes I have remembered for decades!, so for me this is the first book I've ever read that was equal to and not greater than the movie.  For the record, The Virgin Suicides was the only book I've read that was worse than the movie.
"
"
  I've seen the movie years ago, but wanted to read the book, which is usually better at telling the details of the story. This had many facets that made a person think about things they believe in or don't believe in. Each character had their distinct personality.
"
"
  Great book!
"
"
  Love love love. Have been meaning to read it for years and finally got the chance. At first I was upset at how different movie is from book but both are equally scary and compelling stories, so just see them as separate story tellers. Great read from King as always!
"
"
  I usually don't read books by Stephen King, but since this was listed on the 100 books to read for a well read life, I decided to read it.I was mesmerized!  Now I am intrigued and want to read the sequel, Dr. Sleep
"
"
  Gave it 4 stars due to the fact I've already seen the Kubrick movie (gruesome!) and the TV series (which was true to the book & much better in my opinion); wanted to review The Shining before I read Dr. Sleep... enough of a classic Stephen King novel that I knew better than to read it before going to bed!
"
"
  as good as the movie, if kubrick was a giant the creator of the novel stephen king wont stay a bit behind, you must read.
"
"
  A fun read and not too long compared to most of his other works. It's very different from the movie, and I ended up liking both versions!
"
"
  This book certainly keeps you on your toes!  It is very fast paced.  You never know what is around the next corner.  The psychological make-up of the characters is fascinating!

"
  Believe this is a classic. My grand daughter and I view frequently, a multitude of hidden meanings and symbolisms
"
"
  One of my favorite books of all time. Firs king book I ever read.
"
"
  So much better than the movie! But then the books usually are. Stephen King is another amazing novelist. This is s genuinely creepy story. I give it two thumbs up!
"
"
  Classic Stephen King. A worthwhile read even if interested in the movie. Horror, suspense, and mystery rolled into one. Fantastic fiction.
"
"
  I am a Stephen King Fan.  When I saw Dr. Sleep come out I realized I had never read THe Shining!  I had seen the movie many years ago.  The book is excellent and of course way better than the movie.  It was great to read The Shining then move on to Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  What else can you say? THE horror classic by the master of the genre! I actually had never read the novel, but saw the movie first many years ago, and I've always heard that I had to read the book because of some major plot differences. Glad to have finally read it!
"
"
  The horror genre is not my first choice, but I enjoyed The Shining. It definitely had some creepy moments. I'm certainly glad I read it, and it was interesting comparing it to the movie. However, I didn't think much more about the book after I was done. It's not a book that I will be nudging people to pick up and check out. It was good. But meh.
"
"
  One of King’s better stories, and an all together different beast than the movie adaptation. The characters are much more nuanced and fleshed out. Well worth the read.
"
"
  What more can I say about a classic horror story than whats already been written. The shining scared me as a child so I wanted to re-read the story as an adult and see if the terror still holds up. Its funny that certain parts that scared me as a child no longer do, its other areas of the book that are getting my nerves and mind racing.
"
"
  Excellent story, character development, full of twists and very suspenseful. Everyone in my house has read it and felt the same way. The movie is excellent too with the story and characters exactly as you imagine them to look from the book.
"
"
  Slow in parts, but truly a great read. If you liked the movie, you owe it to yourself to get the actual story.
"
"
  The book version is far more frightening and bone-chilling. The movie was creepy but this book scared the heck out of me!
"
"
  For those who have seen the movie, you definitely don't know the whole story. Once again, SK sucks the reader into an impossible to believe situation, and makes a horrible situation entirely possible.Kudos to the master once again.
"
"
  It has been over 25 years since I read The Shining for the first time. I read it again because I had images of the movie in my mind, and I wanted to read Dr. Sleep without picturing Jack Nicholson as Danny's dad. I'm so glad I did. It was a wonderful page-turning experience!
"
"
  One of my favorite King novels. I saw the movie way before reading the book, and wish it could have been the other way around. The novel is 10x better than the movie, and I love the movie! So much scarier and intense. Just read it.
"
"
  I read this book a long time ago but wanted to read it again because of the documentary Room 237 sparked my interest again. I think it is among the best of King's stories. Tons of suspense, story and character development!!The other two best King novels, in MHO are the Dead Zone and The Green Mile.
"
"
  Much more better than ""It"" a lot of psychological terror until the end, really scary and much more than beasts or monsters
"
"
  Stephen King's writing has a quality to make you heart pump and make you feel more anxious than ever. I really love his style and storytelling. He has a way of telling stories that you can distinguish from thousand other authors.I just can't wait to read the sequel to this book.
"
"
  Stephen King at this best!  Far superior to the film.
"
"
  i've always loved the movie version and it was amazing to me to see how different the two are. that being said, i still love the movie as a separate, but similar story from this book. the book though, wow, king really brings you along for a fascinating ride of possession and so much more. definitely worth reading.
"
"
  like it
"
"
  great seller/product
"
"
  I had read this before but after seeing the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, I decided a re-read was in order.
"
"
  I just reread this because I hadn't read it since I was 11. (I had a high school reading level). It scared the heck out of me then, I slept with a nightlight for several months after, and the whole ritual trying to go in my bathroom for the next 6 months,(which had two doors, and a shower curtain that my mother kept closing because SHE hadn't read the book). Needless to say, precocious reader that I was, I was too young for Stephen King then; I loved it. I became a voracious reader of his books, and after The Stand, (which I consider his best novel), this was one of my favorites. I've never watched the movie all the way through, because it would make me think of the book, and would freak me out too much, lol. Anyway, I still enjoyed the book, not as scary this time. I wanted an adult perspective of the story, and to refresh my memory before I read the sequel. I'm glad I reread it, it was worth it. Thoroughly enjoyed.
"
"
  I originally read this book over 20 years ago and I am glad I decided to re-read it.  As an adult, I have a different perspective of the story. I loved every aspect of it, and continue to enjoy all of Stephen Kings works.  If you have never read the book, it's a must read!
"
"
  One of Stephen King's best stories. Jack's obsession and deterioration leads to the inevitable conclusion. King deftly weaves the decline into a fascinating tale.
"
"
  I read The Shining in my late teens or early twenties and thought it was dry & it didn't hold my attention. I revisited it last week, this time as a jaded cynical hag of 35, and found myself absolutely terrified. The isolation. The claustrophobia. The sense of inexplicable, fearful inevitability. I ended up sleeping with my light on more than once.
"
"
  I've read a great deal of Stephen King in my life, but for some reason this is one I missed. This was one of his early novels. I believe the first book of King's I read was The Stand and this one came out before that one. Also at some point I saw the movie with Jack Nicholson, so just never got around to the book until now. Recently however I was given a copy of ""Doctor Sleep"" which is a continuation of the main character in ""The Shining"", so I thought it would be good to read ""The Shining"" before getting into that one. I'm glad I did. ""The Shining"" is classic Stephen King. Even though this is one of his earlier books, I think the writing is just as good as it is now, however in later years King seems to have gotten away from straight supernatural horror type stories, like the Shining and has gotten more into stories that may have an element of the supernatural in them as a set up to the story, but are really more about the characters and the human interactions, like ""Under the Dome"", ""11/22/63"" and most recently ""Mr Mercedes"", which really had no supernatural elements in it at all. However, even though ""The Shining"" was much more of the supernatural, horror type story, the human element was still a key component to the book. King's ability to write about believable characters that really come to life and combine that with unexplained and frightening events is what makes King such a good writer, and one who has stood the test of time. ""The Shining"" is one of those books that stands up to the passing of the years, and is well worth the read, if you missed it like I did. Now I think I'll look at the film again and see how it compares.
"
"
  This book is another excellent example of Mr. King 's macabre thrillers, in which the pace never waivers from start to finish. I would recommend this book to any who like to read the macabre and suspense filled works.
"
"
  Love
"
"
  Love this book would recommend and I only read true crime but love Stephen king
"
"
  Somehow, I missed this book when it came out many years ago. I have been going back and reading all of King's novels and this was just on my list.  Had seen the movie many years ago but the movie does not do the book justice. Stephen King has a uniquely detailed way of developing a character and geting inside his reader's head.  Outstanding read. I will never stay at a hotel called the Overlook.
"
"
  Very easy to read book.  A real page turner for sure.  I’m glad I committed the time to it and will probably read it again someday
"
"
  Good
"
"
  Good Read!
"
"
  This book was way different then the movie and only 1000xs better.
"
"
  This has to be Stephen King's masterpiece.  I've always loved the movie (the original film with Nicholson) and I just recently bought the book.  The print version devotes a lot more time to character development and there are considerable differences between the movie and the book.  If you're a fan of the movie, don't deprive yourself of this book!
"
"
  Great book, I love Stephen King’s work. I read the book before seeing the movie and that was definitely a good choice!
"
"
  It was definitely worth the revisit. I read it years ago and, of course, saw the movie. I was hungry for a King novel and had already read all of his current works, so I started to browse older titles and BOOM! So, even if you read before, read again, it's a classic.
"
"
  Another one of my comfort reads. Love Stephen King! Also, at the end, there is an preview of the sequel to The Shining; Doctor Sleep. I've always wondered whatever happened to little Danny Torrence. Now I'm in the process of reading it!
"
"
  Came quick! Great read for fall!
"
"
  Five stars for the great readI couldn't keep the book down. I needed to keep on reading. I just needed to find out more just by turning the next few pagesAnita mendibles Westover
"
"
  I'm not sure why I'd never read this book until now. The movie adaptation has been a long-time favorite of mine, and I've been a horror buff since I was quite small (honestly probably too young, but oh well lol). This book is so much better than the film. I loved the ending so much more in here in novel format. A must read book, even though it is far older than myself!
"
"
  For a 1980's  take on a book the movie isn't that bad. The acting is a little over the top but that's not why it lost stars for me. I felt like the book built tension at an even pace while giving a rational background for the paranormal activity in the hotel. The movie has rushed pacing and several components of the story were changed and ended up feeling cheesy. For example the character of Danny is a five year old who falls into trances and sees visions in the book. In the movie they didn't seem to know how to film that so they have the character talk to his finger. Cheesy. An example of the pacing being rushed is the initial meeting of Danny and the hotel cook Dick. In the book it's an even paced introduction in which Danny immediately comes out of his shell when he feels a connection to Dick (Dick is the first person he's ever met with a similar psychic gift). Dick takes his time explaining what ""shining"" is and builds a background for all the unusual things that will take place during the story. My last complaint is about what all people who turn books into movies seem to do: they change things for no reason. Instead of the ""bad room"" being number 217 it's 237. Instead of Jack using a roque mallet on his crazy quest it's an ax. Overall it isn't a movie to avoid but if you enjoyed the book then the film will leave you disappointed.
"
"
  The Shining was the first Stephen King Book I ever read. It kept me up nights turning pages and scared me to death. It is still my favorite King book and I have re-read it many times. So I am sure you can imagine my excitement when I heard that they were finally going to release an audio version.I am sorry to say that this reading does not begin to do the story justice. I found Mr. Scott's interpretation flat and uninspired.  Most of the story is read in an almost monotone voice making one of the scariest books I have ever read a cure for insomnia. What also falls flat is Mr. Scott's attempt to create distinct voices for the characters. None sound convincing and I found the voice he used for Tony almost annoying. Thankfully Tony does not have a large speaking part in the book. They would have done much better to get Steven Weber who starred in the mini series to read.It really is a shame they did not pull out all the stops for the audio version, especially since this really is a one-time shot. There will be no re-recording of The Shining. If you must have an audio version of the book this is it. Too bad.
"
"
  This is classic King!  It is one of his first novels I never read. Great book. The original Shining movie really takes pieces from this book, so if you haven't read the book yet I suggest you do!  There's way more in the book!
"
"
  This book speaks for itself. A great overall story line with suspense building throughout!If you have seen the movies but haven't read the book.....you need to read the book! The movies are not the same.....especially the Jack Nicholson version!!The book is more than worth the read....keeping the reader guessing as to what will happen next!
"
"
  better than the movie
"
"
  Well, it's not my favorite Stephen Kings' book but still I like it very much. Author created sort of dark and disquieting world and let the reader go into it. Main characters are very deeply described (in contrast to the movie, where, for example, Wendy is nothing but an ordinary, scared woman) as well as relations between them. Gradual transition of Jack - from ""almost"" good father to the monster is very convincing. Good book, I don't regret the money I spent for it.
"
"
  I read this book the first time in 1978 and again in 2015. My perspective has changed and I found different parts of the book to relate to. I still think this is Stephen King's masterpiece.
"
"
  Wanted to compare to movie.
"
"
  As always Stephen king is an exceptional writer.
"
"
  I loved it.  Fantastic! The hedge animals--that still fascinates me as one the most intriguing and creative perils I've run upon in an occult tale.  Damn good and vividly haunting story. I almost swore at times that I could smell the rotting and decay, the booze and the fierce malevolence and misery! Solid development.  I even hated that hotel after I was done reading.  LoL.
"
"
  Definitely recommend. In a world desensitized by slasher flicks, this book takes delicious time to build up fear. It's more the fear of what people are capable of than what supernatural ghouls haunt us. Great read
"
"
  Forever great. Loved it again and again. Working thru entire King catalog. Forgot how much I love his work. Great!
"
"
  Good book!
"
"
  I loved this book.  After all these years, I finally got a chance to read it and enjoyed it thoroughly.  My only experience had been the movie of many years ago and it didn't do anything for me.  The book was really awesome, tho.  I highly recommend it.  :)
"
"
  This whole book had me wanting more! Every word was so exciting that I couldn't wait to read more. A definite must read.
"
"
  Omg the movie is terrible in comparison please read
"
"
  King never disappoints! Very exciting, full of suspense, chilling page turner! The film definitely missed the mark. Really looking forward to the sequel!
"
"
  This is the first book i have read, that was written by Stephen King. I have to say I was not disappointed, the book gave me something that most horror movies lack these days. A sense of love for each character and a sense of fear. We see the pain and rip in the family, and we feel for Jack even when he has gone insane. The scenes with Danny were creepy, I member having to turn the light on after reading this. While we never truly learn of why the hotel is so evil we do get enough information to feel happy with the ending.All in all i recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of horror.
"
"
  As is the case 99% of books, the written surpasses the movie version.  Not an easy statement for this reader to make, what with Kubrik's movie being my favorite scary movie.  Celluloid v. Paper aside, the book is great, especially if the reader likes the film.
"
"
  I have seen the movie more times than I can count. I just read the book and all I can say is wow!!! The story is much different in the book than the movie. Much more detailed and and explains a lot more about each character. I loved it!
"
"
  Huge fan of the film with Jack Nicholson and while I knew the book was different going in, I was pleasantly surprised at how much was different and expanded upon. I won't post spoilers but there are some things the film did that the book didn't but the same can be said the other way around. The book greatly told much that the film left out about not only the Torrence family but the Overlook and some of the ghostly guests that stayed there. If you like the film at all, the book is more of the same spooky fun, a bit different and keeps you interested.
"
"
  A classic; brilliant and compelling, suspense builds throughout the novel as the narrative builds towards the eventual conclusion.Although I've seen the film, and Kubrick's adaptation is phenomenal, the novel carries it to another level.
"
"
  So much raw details you can smell and taste what is happening every page. Loved this book! I reccomend this to anyone, also a good intro book for his style of writing!
"
"
  awesome book plain and simple, its really really good and im sorry but the sequel just isn't as good, i found it over the top with the characters and it lost the point that this book made so clear, the shining is a classic and i love it :)
"
"
  The Shinning is really a classic and I remember when I read it for the first time.  This was the first book that I read of Mr. Kings and it literally scared the pants of of me.  I know that there are probably more scary books out now, but at that time not so much.  I was working for Chevrolet and building transmissions at the time and every free second I got I would read a few pages, take it home and stay up late, not being able to put down the book.  I just could not believe that a book could make me not want to turn off the light.  It is still great.  I just love this story.
"
"
  reread this book in anticipation of dr. sleep...highly recommend doing so...rediscover the smooth subtle quiet horror of a man being swept up in his own madness taken over by forces he cannot control...better than you remember i promise,,,
"
"
  I saw this movie years ago but had never read the book. A page turner for sure. The battle between good and evil is always the base for a great story and who can tell a scary story better thanStephen King !
"
"
  The thing I love about King books and this one Included is you never have to worry about important details being brushed off or left unsaid. You know the dynamics of characters and the ins and outs of the story. I would recommend this book highly to people who are new to Stephen King 's literary work. On  thing to keep in mind reading King is the first half of the book may seem drab and drawn out but once you get past that first initial section hold on to your seat your in for the ride of your life.
"
"
  So much better than the movie. At once a sad and horrific story that also exemplifies love. King never fails to impress me.
"
"
  I had previously only watched the film. Then I read Dr. Sleep and couldn't stop myself from reading this, just on principal. I am a HUGE Stephen King fan and I feel remiss in my delay of reading this wonderfully constructed work. I am never disappointed by Mr. King...
"
"
  Better than the movie.
"
"
  I enjoyed the challenge set up for the family. The cabin fever in itself was typically difficult. Stephen King made it s sorry e tough to make me slam the kindle shut.  I WAS SURPRised at the racial references and x-rated stuff..but I Suppose that was the realistic part unlike the topiary animals!
"
"
  Really strange story -- but really good read
"
"
  It's a good book, little slow in the beginning out really picks up and pulls you in. Classic that everyone should read at some point in their lives.

  The Shining was very well written. I wish the movie followed the book as it had much more details and has more compassion than the movie. Very well written!
"
"
  I've been a fan for nearly 30 years, yet had never read this offering from Mr. King.  Since a book coming out later this year is going to deal with the young protagonist, Danny, all grown up, I decided to get the back story.  I was not disappointed.  The characters are well fleshed out and King provides such keen details in all his works that his books play like movies in my mind.I am now anxiously awaiting Doctor Sleep this fall.
"
"
  My step really wanted this book. She was very happy when I gave it to her. She hasn't read it yet but was very happy when she got it. It arrived fast and it great condition. This is a book for people who love to read. It's a huge book.
"
"
  This is one of the best Stephen king books ever written. It has that great creepiness and the psychological thriller factor to it, which his newer books seems to be lacking.
"
"
  I chose this rating because this book was just amazing. This is the fist Stephen king novel I've read, will not be the last. I don't think I've ever read a book this good. Stephen king is truly talented. I decided to read The Shining because I found the movie very good. Scratch that thought, the book makes the movie look like the producers didn't give a dank about the book. If only people didn't have to ruin amazing books with bad movies.
"
"
  Suspense around every corner. Always a fun read by King from beginning to end. Bring on the sequel. Hoping for the best
"
"
  I have owned this book for years but after seeing the movie (and loving it) I didn't think I needed to. I heard there was another book - a continuance of the book. So I finally read it. It was amazing! Somethings were the same and alot was different but I loved both. Definitely a great book!!
"
"
  Disturbing is the word that comes to mind but I could not put the book down. It is great storytelling because as a reader you can imagine yourself snowed in for months & wonder what your mind would do to you.
"
"
  Just finished re-reading it before doctor sleep comes out.  Still creepy and scary over 30 years later.  I can understand shy Stephen King did not like the Stanley Kubrick movie version of his book.  They are so different and the book is so much scarier!
"
"
  One of Stephen King's best stories. Get the Jack Nicholson image out your head and visualize your own characters. My only objection continues to be King's fairly inept ear for dialogue. I keep asking: ""Who talks that way?""
"
"
  I love Stephen King! Get all images of the movie out of your head before reading, the movie does not do this book justice! Scariest book I have ever read! Had my heart racing, house creaks freaking me out, nightmares and scary dreams because I read before bed!! Awesome book.
"
"
  I read this again as a refresher before starting Doctor Sleep.  Love The Shining!  It was just as good (maybe better) as the first time that I read it!  If you have only seen the movie....you are missing out.
"
"
  Book arrived promptly. Stephen King is always good reading material. I paid $4 with free shipping with the mass produced paperback. Absolutely worth the price, the book is smaller with over 600 pages. The script is small but readable.
"
"
  the king. liked the movie, but loved the book.  much more detailed and interesting. really excited to read dr. sleep.
"
"
  Good reading.
"
"
  The book arrived on time and is in good condition except there are 2 pages missing so far I am not even half way into it so I don't know if there are more missing.
"
"
  I have seen the movie...but never read the book.  Only after buying Doctor Sleep novel did I realize that Doctor Sleep was a,sequel to The Shining. So I bought The Shining and as with all of King 's novels, I really enjoyed it.  Now off to read Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  I think this is one of the best books King ever wrote. I actually read this book when it first came out in print and have re-read it many times. Downloaded a copy because downloaded books are handier than the paper copies
"
"
  a classic in hard cover, cannot beat that.
"
"
  This is my favorite Stephen King book.  I read it years ago and bought this CD audio version and it is fantastic.  First you have to get Shelly Duval out of your head from the movie version, but if you can this reading is really wonderful.  It was used so the package is a little banged up, but the disc were all perfect.  Next I'm going to listen to Dr. Sleep to find out how Danny turned out.
"
"
  awesome book!
"
"
  I saw the movie many years ago and put off reading the book even though I'm a Stephen King fan. The book of course has much more depth than the movie and the story line is different enough that it was not at all predictable.  A good read, even if you've seen the movie!
"
"
  Read this book when it first came out and loved it.  Bought it for my Kindle Fire to read again before Stephen King's sequel ""Dr. Sleep"" came out to refresh my memory.  Still as chilling and scary as I remember.  So much better then the movie.
"
"
  I think that this is the only Stephen King book that I had not read. I had heard that the movie differed from the book and went back to read the book before reading 'Doctor Sleep'. It is a great story and IMO better than the movie.
"
"
  My brother loves Stephen King!
"
"
  Excellent story, from when Steven King was still a good writer.
"
"
  WOW! I loved it! Great read, not difficult language, very dark subjects. I see why this American Classic is so well known, Worth the time, 100%,
"
"
  Favorite
"
"
  If you like Steven King, thrillers, suspense, or the film, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS NOVEL.  It's one of my favorites.
"
"
  Finally getting around to reading this classic. This is much better than the movie. Stephen King takes his time developing the characters and back story. I had not issues reading this on the Kindle.
"
"
  Perfect and spine chilling! As a first Stephen King book I'd definitely recommend this.
"
"
  This was a compelling story that sucked me in and really made the characters believable. Each character had depth to them. The only complaint I have is that perhaps some of the details about some of the characters were unnecessarily lengthy in my opinion.
"
"
  I loved getting into the minds of Jack and Danny.
"
"
  I love how this book flows...I didn't want to put it down.  I have read this book several times over the years and it gets better each time.  One of Stephen King's best
"
"
  This is one of the best books I have ever read! Stephen King is the master of horror.
"
"
  I am becoming a fan of the shining and it was a great read!
"
"
  Awesome read. Better than the movie.
"
"
  Bought this as a gift for my daughter who absolutely adores everything Stephen King.
"
"
  But if you don't know by now that the book is always better, I don't know what you've been doing with your life. The Shining goes into so much more detail, you'll almost feel cheated by the movie adaptations. I have to be honest here and say I only saw the Nicholson movie, but I'm pretty sure about the other one too not touching this book by a longshot.
"
"
  It gave me nightmares but I still liked the book. The book was a bit smaller than I thought but it was still nice condition.
"
"
  Good book, better than the movie. The hotel is its own character  and truly a terrifying place, loved the ending. Would recommend.
"
"
  Always good. <U+2661>
"
"
  Reread after several years and totally loved the book again.  The movie is great, but really isn't anything like the book.  Couldn't put it down, loved, loved, loved it.  Visit the Overlook though the writer's eyes.
"
"
  Finally had a chance to read The Shining and wow it's an eye opener, it really answers a lot of the questions I had after seeing the movie.
"
"
  Way up there in my list of best books I’ve ever read. Such a different beast from the movie, each special in their own way.
"
"
  I finally read the Shining and I'm so glad I did. I was a pretty big fan of the movie until I read the book. Now I realize what my friend meant when he said Kubrick butchered it. The book is way better than the film, although most times that is usually the case.
"
"
  Though the movie was one of the truest to his books from this period, I do hope they remake it again with actual demonic topiary figures rather than the lame maze the put in the original.  Stephen King was never so good as in his earliest books and this one is a favorite.
"
"
  Yes. I saw the movie first and wanted to read the book. The night I finished reading it, I had to sleep with the lights on. The book has so much depth and I was so engrossed by the characters and their development. I've been talking about it non-stop, since I finished and recommending it to everyone. This book will truly stay with me for a while. Goosebumps, even thinking about it.
"
"
  The first Stephen King I've ever read, and I've gotta say, I'm jumping on the bandwagon. I never thought I'd like his style because everyone raves about him so much and makes him out to be a god of some sort, but now I understand. I still don't consider him to be a divine gift of literary creativity, but I did enjoy this novel and will purchase more of his work.
"
"
  Classic Stephen King and a good read.  Probably would have enjoyed it more if I had not seen the movie long ago. It was much better than the movie, but since I knew what was coming, the suspense was not there.  I decided to read it before reading Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  Great book, great value for the price, highly recommend.
"
"
  One of King's best works. Well written and keeps the reader gripped right from the start all the way to the end. I must have read this book at least 10 times over the years and it always keeps me entertained.
"
"
  After reading a 11/22/63, I wanted to read some more Stephen King and picked the Kindle version of this book for a few dollars. The book is pretty slow for the first half, but picks up quickly into the Torrence's stay at the Overlook Hotel. The story is very intriguing and will keep you drawn in, especially if you know next to nothing about the story going in, like I did.
"
"
  I finally sat down to read this and it was good but I didn't get the same gripping concern as I have from other Stephen King novels.It had some interesting events occur but for some reason it did not pan up the all the expectations people give you about this particular story.
"
"
  I read this book for the first time 40 years ago as a 16 yr old & was terrified.  It still hold up to anything out there, & still packs the same page-turning, keep you reading till the end kind of horror that Stephen King is known for!  Love this classic!
"
"
  An excellent work of classic horror, in which the scariness is equal parts otherworldly and within. I have a new appreciation for these characters after years of only ever watching the more surface level Kubrick flick.
"
"
  I loved this book. Excellent character development.  Scary.  Surprisingly different from the movie. It kept me at the edge of my seat even though I've seen the movie a couple of times.  Great to read it before reading Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  Love it! Not really surprised
"
"
  I would recommend this book to Stephen King fans everywhere, not like the movie but just as scary and with more intimacy.
"
"
  I'm a Stephen King-oholic anyway. I think I've seen every King movie ever made and read almost every Stephen King book written, but The Shining I had to go back for twice. The only other book I've read more than this was Storm Of The Century. After I saw the movie I had to read the book. I grew up watching The Shining(And Cujo amongst others as most millennials did), I read the book when I was sixteen but that was sixteen years ago. I saw this when I was looking for a Rita Mae Brown book to read and bought this instead. I love Stephen King's stories, they take you to places you're too afraid to go and make you look at things in an almost flip-side to reality sort of way.I think The Shining is sort of like that. What you think would be a serene winter of taking care of this old hotel turns into an absolute horror. Who would think of a winter in a haunted a** hotel, where your husband drops his bag of marbles and the only road out of town is closed for the winter? Then you have your kid with you too!!! Now that is a pure nightmare.

  Danny, the son of Jack and Wendy, has the ability to ""shine"", that is hearing what others are thinking, as well as communicating with them via the mind and seeing things that will happen in the future. The three of them, Jack (a former alcoholic), Wendy, and Danny (their six-year-old son) are staying at a beautifully located hotel, Hotel Overlook (in Colorado), where Jack is planning to continue working on his play.They meet with the owner of the hotel, Mr. Ullman, a somewhat dislikable person, who shows them around and gives the instructions on how to run the hotel over their months-long stay. It is autumn at their time of arrival.Danny, who is like any other six-year-old boy, but who is more intelligent than most at that age, one day has a ""shining"" incident, where he locks himself in the bathroom because his imaginary friend Tony says he must. After that incident (and another where he is stung by some wasps), they decide to let him see a doctor. The doctor explains to the parents that Danny is like any ordinary kid, only smarter and more attentive to the details of Jack and Wendy's relationship (he has read their thoughts about divorce without them having said it).Jack in the meantime has read some newspapers about the history of the Overlook hotel, and he decides to write a book about its mysterious history. The hotel is not like any other hotel; it has a strange history, and the hotel seems to have a mind of its own. At the same time, Jack battles with his alcohol problems, and has a large role in what happens next.The novel is filled with exciting incidents and you can easily picture the situations in the book.I won't tell what happens in the ending, but if you are into scary books by Stephen King, I can only recommend that you read this book. The sequel to the book is ""Doctor Sleep"".
"
"
  Amazing book that will leave you sucked in.
"
"
  Knowing there's a sequel to this book based on the now grown Danny Torrance; (Dr. Sleep) I decided to read this first....  Definitely different than the movie with Nicholson; actually better.  Why Stanley Kubrick made such drastic changes is beyond me.  A very good read....
"
"
  As much as a Stephen King fan that I am, I never picked up The Shining until now. And only because I found out it it the prequel to Doctor Sleep. The Shining is creepy and it absolutely kept me on the edge of my sleep. I can't wait to read the sequel.
"
"
  The book blows the movie out of the water.  You should never watch that movie again because it was so poorly made.  I read The Shining because I had read Doctor Sleep and actually read them in reverse order.  It explains so much more about what the ""shine"" really is and you never get that in the movie.  I highly recommend you read the book, forget the movie!
"
"
  Love this book!  It's one of the first books of Stephen King's that I read and I have been hooked since.  I ordered this on my Kindle because I wanted to reread it before reading the sequel, Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  This book certainly kept me on my toes but it was also lackluster within the middle of the story. It almost became hard to read as I was losing so much interest. It did leave a very detailed back story but king could have dialed it down some. 3.5 over a!l!
"
"
  Great book. Recommend the read; the movie doesn't do it justice.
"
"
  You are a horror fan. You love good charactor development and being scared out of your whits. Why haven't you read this book yet? Go on! Buy it.
"
"
  I love the movie but friends kept telling me it doesn't do the book justice and that I really should read it.  So I thought, hey, I'm willing to try anything once, even Stephen King, but boy, was I disappointed with  this novel.It started out promising enough with just enough metaphors,  motifs and compulsive thinking to keep things interesting and spooky but  about half way through the book (about the time all that supernatural stuff  gets going) King begins hammering the reader over the head with  heavy-handed allusions and repeated references as though he's afraid we  won't get it.Maybe it's just that I don't have much tolerance for or  interest in magical thinking but I found the last half of the book tedious  bordering on  silly.  To my mind, the scariest part of the book by far was  something that could have happened in real life -- the episode with the  wasps nest in Danny's room.  But I also think that the things real human  beings are capable of doing to each other are far more horrifying than  anything involving an elevator that moves on it's own, background ballroom  music, the whirring machinations of a wind-up clock or a hotel taking over  the body and mind of a sad, pathetic, middle-aged man.
"
"
  Pretty deep film.  It has been quoted a lot in books I am currently reading so I had to have a private showing in my home theater.  You will like I am sure.  Steven King does it up right!
"
"
  OMG! Saw this movie as a kid and the book was so much better! I have never experienced my heart thumping fast from reading a book before, felt like I was living the story with them. Stephen King is a master story teller!
"
"
  a must read. Do buy
"
"
  This book came out forever ago, and I just read it for the first time. I've only recently got into the horror/thriller genre, but this is easily the best one I've read. I loved it! His writing is masterful, the story is terrifying without being over the top, and I was on the edge of my seat until the end.
"
"
  Classic novel. Read it years ago (as a teen) and it gave me nightmares. Read it again recently just to refresh my memory and to get ready to read his follow-up book, Doctor Sleep.  The Shining is one of his greatest books... no nightmares this time, but definitely stayed on my mind for weeks.
"
"
  Had to read it one more time before I read the second book. Sold my paperback at a garage sale and have my hard copy packed away some where. Thank you for putting your books on kindle. I have asthma and have had to pack my book away. My husband wants to throw them out, I can't!!!!
"
"
  This book was amazing! If you're a Mystery/Thriller fan this would be the perfect book for you! I've always loved Stephen King movies, but some how I'm always finding myself to love the books more! It gives you more background on the characters, and you find yourself way more involved than the movie. However, don't get me wrong Stephen Kings movies always rocks!
"
"
  This is an amazing read to the very last page. I can't wait for 'Dr. Sleep' to arive.
"
"
  Book came in a timely manner and was in brand new condition.  Very pleased. The boom itself is a little boring in the beginning, but that has nothing to do with amazon
"
"
  One of Stephen King's earlier classics. Well worth the read. Note that the follow up novel Dr. Sleep is coming out shortly, if it is not out already, making it a good time to read this book again, or for the first time if you haven't yet.
"
"
  I'm not into the paranormal, but Stephen King does such as wonderful job of making it all seem real. A fantastic wordsmith that keeps you glued to the edge of your seat.
"
"
  Had to go back and read this again after reading Doctor Sleep, which was so intriguing I just had to read The Shining again!
"
"
  The real story of what happened at the Overlook that winter...Kubrick's film pales in comparison to King's novel, as you'll find out when you open the cover and enter the world of the Torrances.
"
"
  Love this book... Saw it when i was 7 for the first time. fell in love with the story been a stephen king fan ever since.
"
"
  The Shining is a fantastically written book that is much better than the movie. Everything seems to be a symbol, and the use of color is very interesting. There are a lot of mysteries to figure out which makes reading it fun. I definately reccommend it to people who have seen the movie and enjoyed it, but the book I think you would like more.
"
"
  I finally got to read this book in its entirety!  The book is certainly much better than the movie!!
"
"
  King’s masterpiece does not disappoint.
"
"
  I read this to understand why my daughter liked to read Stephen King novels. Slow moving at first and then I was engrossed.
"
"
  Great story! If you're interested in horror or even just curious about the Stephen King novels, this is a wonderful beginning. The story will keep you captivated and on the edge of your seat!
"
"
  Great summer read. I read it first in my 20's and now again in my 50's. This time, it seemed to be even more intense. Terrific!
"
"
  great book.  I read it because I intended to read Dr Sleep and wanted to start with the original.  The Shinning was very good, but Dr Sleep was not.  Also, The Shinning was much different than the movie.
"
"
  Book was in nice condition
"
"
  Came as expected and was a great book!
"
"
  I saww the movie first an then read the book.As always, the book is incredibly better than the movie, and much scarier...I was scared the whole time while I read it, had an opressive feeling that King wisely transmitted through every page.A masterpiece, and highly recommendable.
"
"
  A great read, if you love being scared, and I love being scared. This is quintessential King, with good vs. evil, and  it keeps you on the edge of your seat to see how it turns out.
"
"
  Well written—must read Stephen King.
"
"
  Definitely one of Steven King's finest novels.  If you've seen the movie, the book is similar, albeit with a few plot changes.
"
"
  I like this book. But there was some thing missing, it left me wanting more. I would like to see the movie. Was was just expecting more from a Stephen King book.
"
"
  Excellent book.If you love the movie this book will enhance your liking of it more. Great character developmentI think it's better than movie or miniseries and enhances your viewing of either one
"
"
  I am a huge Stephen King fan and I hadn't read the Shining until now. It's so much different and better than the movie!
"
"
  I ordered the mass-market Market paperback editon wth two day shipping.I  opened it within 10 minutes of receiving it. As soon as I took it out I noticed a rip on the back cover hence the reason for a 4 rating. But since it'sonly on the back cover I'll still keeping read.
"
"
  One of my favorites of Mr Kings, I prefer the old stuff. Scary and kept me up.
"
"
  Best horror story ever! Read this book...you will be terrified
"
"
  Read ""The Shining"" many years ago when it first came out and still consider it the best book Stephen King ever wrote. They butchered the movie with miscasting, but the book remains, to me, one of the scariest books of all time!
"
"
  I try to read this book a few year ago but didn't quite catch me so I abandoned. Try again and read in less than a mouth. Considering the amount of time that I have free to read, it's a good time. As a fan of Stephen King, it's a must read book.
"
"
  This is a great Stephen King book.  The detailed narratives and the heart stopping suspense keep you on the edge of your seat and unable to put the book down.  Read it numerous times but it still has me entranced.
"
"
  Book arrived damaged and dirty. the front cover was broken there is mysterious stain on the top of the book.
"
"
  This was a reread for me, it didn't disappoint and it did prepare me for reading Dr. Sleep
"
"
  I loved it! I read this book because of the introduction of Stephen King's new book, Doctor Sleep. The new book focuses on the child in The Shining, Danny. It had been years since I had seen the movie or read The Shining, so I treated myself to a second read. The characters were so well-developed over a period of time. The horror of the story was balanced by how well-grounded Danny's character was. One of King's finest. Now I can't wait to read Doctor Sleep.Kathleen Kearns
"
"
  No matter how hard I looked, I was unable to find this in paperback anywhere. The movie was amazing, but like with every other novel made into a movie, the book is way better. This is one of my all time favorites preceded only by the gunslinger series and dreamcatcher.
"
"
  Stephen King Classic. Really nothing more needs to be said. The man puts ink to paper and greatness is the result. Wonderful character and scene development. Wonderful story telling. Wonderful.
"
"
  It was exciting and bizzare....everything I love in Stephen King books. You think you know what is going to happen next, but you are way wrong. Fun plot twists.
"
"
  I love the intrigued.
"
"
  Reading it again for the first time in 30 years, before reading Doctor Sleep, King still manages to terrorize. Scariest scene: when Wendy stabs Jack on the stairway, and he gets up, saying, ""You killed me, you bitch!!""
"
"
  I haven’t read this book in years but it still is as good as I remember. I really recommend it!
"
"
  Fun read!
"
"
  I loved the movie and now all these years later - I'm ready the book (again).  Of course the book is better than the movie - it always it!  So glad to be able to purchase this ""classic"" on Amazon for my Kindle Fire....
"
"
  I'this is one of his bestm a Stephen King fan and this is one of his best that I read when it first cam out and decided to reread.  Didn't disappoint!
"
"
  Couldn't put the book down , so good. One of the best by King and well worth the time. Recommend
"
"
  Amazing. So good. I am literally in awe. Wow. How many more words until this is done again? Oh two.
"
"
  Why can't the movie be more like the book? The book was great! Why change the room number? Doesn't make any sense. On to Dr. Sleep!
"
"
  Great book
"
"
  I never saw the movie or read the book so my curiosity compelled me to read it. Good suspense.
"
"
  Good read. Long but not bad.
"
"
  Pretty good, It wasn't my favorite but it was still good...I think everyone should read the book before seeing the movie.
"
"
  I've watched the movie dozens of times through my life and I had so many unanswered questions. I get it now. Excellent book, thick vocabulary and a rush that keeps the reader riveted.
"
"
  Haven't read a book since that was ""better"" though I haven't read many since.Sometimes I didn't understand how Jack was so possible to break down.I also kind of don't like how there is a steady, yet choppy and then jumpy movement into sheer ""magic"" the bolt that slides open.Jack becoming immune to death&pain...I just did not get it?Make's me not want to read IT as I imagine the same kind of mechanisms are likely in play.Still, I loved it
"
"
  I love the older books by King. His newer work's not so much. The Shining was way better than the movie as in most book to movies stories.
"
"
  This was a reread for me ion preparing to read Mr King.""s latest .  He is a very talented writer. Have loved reading his books since the sixties.  Never see the movies, but love his magic with the written word.
"
"
  This is probably one of the best books ive ever read.. Definitely in the top 3 all time from Steven King.
"
"
  Pretty much a typical Stephen King offering.  God forbid he should ever write a book with a happy ending, but that's probably part of the reason he has dedicated readers like me!. Guess we're as sick as he is.
"
"
  Never ages, and I had to stop reading at night. Brillant, and I can't wait to delve into Doc Sleep next.
"
"
  Love the old Stephen King! Cold chills in the summer time. Just when you think you have it all figured out, ""something"" new pops out and spills your popcorn.
"
"
  After reading Doctor Sleep, I had to go back and pick up The Shining!  I was not disappointed.  I was going off from memory from the Kubrick movie based on the book.  As is typical for movies made from King's books, it cannot compare.  The Shining was fantastic.
"
"
  This is the Mona Lisa of horror stories. So terrifying there are times...even after all these years...after reading this book so many times. I find myself sleeping with the light on and the book stored safely in another room.  You can quibble with other, later works by . King. But this one is his masterpiece.
"
"
  I started reading Doctor Sleep before I realized I was apparently missing some really big plot points. Thought I had read The Shining before but boy was I wrong. It's definitely a King classic and I'm sorry I hadn't read it sooner!
"
"
  I liked how Mr. Hollaran was alive in the end and how the hotel burned down. It’s better than the movie.
"
"
  I received the new version of the shining when it specifically says the ""Original Cover."" A bunch of BS.
"
"
  King is a masterful storyteller. I couldn't put this down, again. It's thoughtful horror, smart horror, so horrific because it's almost believable. Movie first or book first- doesn't matter, they each stand on their own.
"
"
  Saw the movie years ago and decided to read the book. So very pleased to read the book.
"
"
  This book is one of King's best. I ordered it to read before I read Doctor Sleep which is a follow up to The Shining and am glad I did. It was a refresher on the characters and scenes that come into play with the new book.
"
"
  It's Stephen King.  Enough said!
"
"
  Not bad. Not bad at all.
"
"
  I had seen the movie of The Shining, but never felt the need to read the book.  Now with his new book about the character Danny, I felt the need to read it, and I'm glad I did.  The movie was good, but a lot of details from the book were missing.  All I can say is it was so worth the $ I paid for it!
"
"
  Love this!
"
"
  One of Stephen Kings classics! This book is great in a sense that it draws and keeps you locked in from beginning to end. I recommend it to anyone that loves suspenseful/ thriller novels, without the typical formula/ending you find with other books. I can't wait to read the sequel.The movie is great but different! There are many more creepy and suspenseful things hidden in this novel that weren't touched upon in the movie. If you love the movie then you are in for more of a surprise in the book!!

  Book is wonderful and builds up to a screaming climax! Love it. This was a great Christmas read, oddly enough.
"
"
  I love the movie, but it never made total sense to me. after reading the book all the gaps are filled in, I loved this book it is amazing!
"
"
  After seeing the movie recently I was intrigued enough to check out the book. Never having been a big King fan I was apprehensive, but really enjoyed this book.The top horror book I have read. Highly recommended.
"
"
  I had been meaning to read this for many years and just never seemed to have the time. Now I am glad I made the time. This book is everything I have always loved about Stephen King. Well thought out, well told and just enough fantasy to make it work. If you have ever wanted to read The Shining and weren't sure, do it. You won't regret it. Promise.
"
"
  good stuff.
"
"
  This is easily my favorite book by Stephen King. Love the setting. Love the characters. Love it all. This is the second time I've read it and it was just as good, intense and entertaining as it was 20-years ago when I first read it. What was Stanley Kubrick thinking when he destroyed this in the movies???
"
"
  If you're a fan of reading books, fiction or non fiction, this book is a must read. Gripping storytelling from start to finish, very few do it better then Stephen King. Take a day off, go sit at a park bench or your favorite reading place, and enjoy a true masterpiece. King makes you feel like you're in the Overlook hotel with Danny. Greatness doesn't need to be over-described, just read the book!
"
"
  Got this for my daughter. Very nice book in great condition.
"
"
  I read ""The Shining"" in the 1970s, but this is one Stephen King novel I read repeatedly.  My hard copy was so worn out, I decided to add it to my Kindle collection.
"
"
  Love his books.
"
"
  The book is great i would recommend
"
"
  Book arrived in great condition.  The story and book diverge a bit.  Highly recommend the sequel too ""Doctor Sleep"".
"
"
  This book will take you on a fantastic ride of the completely insane Overlook Hotel.  Just by reading this the reader can only imagine the part of Jack Torrence portrayed by Jack Nicholson.  This book is a non stop adventure into the ever strengthening power that the Overlook possesses over the caretaker and his family.
"
"
  You must read the Shining, it is better than the movie.The shining ends differently than the movie, if I remember right.
"
"
  I absolutely love this book! So much more detail than the movie. I like the movie but of course the book is always better!
"
"
  If you don't know what it's about, I won't spoil it (also, wow). Very tense, very creepy, very good example of Stephen King's work.
"
"
  An excellent book with details that helped me understand the movie that I saw years ago.  Very interesting with many twists and turns
"
"
  I've read a fair number of King's novels and the ones I've loved have been few and far between. I decided to read this one because I had read about the author's opinions on the movie and how he had intended this as a metaphor for his alcoholism and felt the movie lost that. It's not always a fun read, but I loved the layers and depth of the story.
"
"
  I saw the movie, have been wanting tom read the book, the book is better. The movie missed some of the people character that is necessary to understand what is going on.
"
"
  I'm only about 3/4 of the way through, but so far this book has been nothing short of awesome.  King does a great job of bringing us into the minds of the main characters and has been raising and lowering the tension throughout the novel so far.  Definitely recommended.
"
"
  Everything I have ever read by him as always kept me on the edge of m seat, and this story is no different. If you've seen the movie and said to yourself you have no need to read this because I saw the movie and it had Jack Nicholson.....you are dead wrong! This story has so much suspense and buildup you have to read it! And besides the movie is completely different and the movie has an alternate ending........read this book and sees how the shining was meant to be !
"
"
  Stephen King's the Shining book... thank you for fast delivery
"
"
  A fun book. I had forgotten so much of this story. I think I've seen the movie too many times. The book and the movie are so opposite to each other. BOOK: Wendy is blonde. MOVIE: Wendy is brunette. BOOK: Jack writing a play. MOVIE: Jack writing a novel.  BOOK: Jack burns to death. MOVIE: Jack freezes to death. There are so many interesting things to compare between the two mediums, it's no wonder they've  been so widely studied.
"
"
  My son enjoyed the book. He is a fan.
"
"
  I haven't read the book just yet. I just wanted to write a review on how quick it got to me. I couldnt believe it. I literally placed the order 1 day ago. Im sure the book is great. Ill update when I am done.
"
"
  I don't really like Stephen King overall, but I've always really liked this book. The physical quality of this edition is also fantastic. I'm very pleased.
"
"
  I thought that this would be one would be a good start for my 12 year old Grandaughter who wants to start reading Stephen King.Lots of scary parts.
"
"
  I'm not one to read alot of King books due to his long dragged out attention to detail. Although this book is as always better than the movie. Alot of things happen in the book that was left out, added, or changed in the movie. For sure a book that people who don't always read King books should give a try
"
"
  10x better than the movie - finding this gem just now - the last 35-40% of the book is hard to put down.
"
"
  AMAZING! As entertaining as the movie was, the book tells the real story....I highly recommend it!
"
"
  Not my favorite king book, but did enjoy it. Was expecting more horror. From all I have heard about it, was expecting lot more.
"
"
  I just got done reading this book for the 2nd time and it seemed to affect me more this time around than the first time.  I believe it is by far better than the movie (although, the movie was great in its own right).  I would definitely recommend this one to anyone looking for a good read.
"
"
  Great service. Item as described.
"
"
  Anything by Stephen King is wonderful.  I have every  book he's published in hard cover, first edition.
"
"
  This is definitely a real page turner. It kept me on the edge of my seat. The novel plays on the fact that even a basically good person can be lured to ""the dark side"".
"
"
  Bought this book to go with the Doctor Sleep, because he had not read the Shining and wanted to read it, before reading Doctor Sleep. He's a  long time fan of Stephen King's book.
"
"
  What's not to love?!?  It's Stephen king!!  Great read!!
"
"
  Stephen King is a masterful writer from whom I have learned much. I highly recommend each of his books not only for their stories, but mostly for learning the craft an art of writing.
"
"
  Great book. I was happy with the condition of my purchase.
"
"
  This book was much better than the movie. It gave you an understanding of the grip of the Overlook Hotel plummeting the players into ""insanity"". Plus, a happier ending!!...it was hard to put down.
"
"
  Stephen King is always amazing, and this is a great book to learn his writing style.
"
"
  I bought this book for my almost 13 year-old daughter. She never put the book down and she said it was one of the best books she had ever read. And she is an extreme bookworm and any book she likes is a great book.
"
"
  One of my favorite Stephen King novels!
"
"
  Read this first, then watch Kubrick's movie, then read the above book by Paul Whittington. Compare and contrast. Hey, did Paul take a class in Junior College English? Film? Was this his term paper or project?
"
"
  I am a big fan of the movie but the book was a step above.  King has a great flare for the macabe and horror/suspense.  I found myself getting chills as I read through the novel.  I wish the movie had followed the book a little more closely, especially the second half of the novel.  This is one of his earlier works but one of his best.  Look forward to reading his new book, Mr. Mercedes.  Bravo!Chris Walton, M.D.Mobile, AL
"
"
  I understand why Steven king was unhappy with the movie version of his novel. after seeing the movie and then reading the novel, the movie missed the major points of the novel. The movie concentrated on the ""horror"" points, while the novel delved into the phycological aspects of the main person,Jack.
"
"
  Although the movie is one of my favorites, the book gives so much more background about the Torrence's.  That really makes a difference. If by some weird chance you haven't seen the movie yet read the book first. You get the best of both worlds then!
"
"
  scary book. great read.
"
"
  This puts the movie to shame. I'd be embarrassed to be associated with the movie in any way, shape or form after having read the book.
"
"
  I am just on the 4th chapter, but I love the storyline, it keeps you interested and is full with suspense, you will keep turning the pages as you want to know what is going to happen and don’t wanna miss any detail!
"
"
  Steven king is the master story teller of all time so it is no surprise that this story is filled with his unique style and page turning suspense.
"
"
  Stephen King's thriller will keep you awake at night even after you've finished reading it.  It has the ""Exorcist"" effect.
"
"
  One of King's  best. Always liked the older stuff of his. Highly recommend. If you haven't read anything by him yet or started with his latest stuff, read this one.
"
"
  Formulaic for King. Supernatural superhuman events in a clear well told raw story. Good background, storyline, conflict, and resolution. Good core read for Stephen King fans.
"
"
  All work and no play!  The book really is better than the movie and the movie was great.  If you are a Stephen King fan you have already read it ... If you aren't then read this and become one.
"
"
  Not a bad book, but not as good as Carrie, in my opinion.  The first four parts of the book were great, but the last part got a little too silly for my tastes.  It seemed to me that the story was going in the direction of a man who was simply going insane and that would have been a good way to conclude it without bringing in supernatural aspects of the hotel.  It would have been interesting to see how everything was explained through Jack's insanity.  But that's not how it was done.  The story was well told, regardless, and King's attention to detail in his writing gets better with each book I read.
"
"
  I used to be scared to read anything by Stephen King. This book is absolutely creepy but made me want to keep reading the whole way through. Way better than the movie ever was, and way different.
"
"
  I've never been much of a S. King fan, but have enjoyed reading a few of his books. The Shining is one of them. The book has it's secrets and turns upside down out of nowhere. Great peice to read, and as a young adult, I am ashamed to say that I had nightmares when I was reading this!-ENJOY!
"
"
  arrive in good condition-book looks almost as good as new
"
"
  As a huge fan of the movie and never had read the book, I went in with different expectations. And, while at times the story seemed to drag a bit, the second half was fast, and furious. Good overall, but honestly, still more of a fan of the movie. Sorry, Mr. King.
"
"
  My favorite
"
"
  I liked the book and the ending was perfect. I thought the book was mostly heart pounding until you reached the end.
"
"
  A classic must read. :)
"
"
  This story is simply amazing. It will shock you to your core, and it will chill your heart and bones. Mr. King has created a bone-chilling, spine-tingling modern-horror classic, and the suspenseful psychology will keep you on your seat until the very end. Very thoughtfully and thoroughly written, definitely a marvel worth reading at least once in your lifetime.
"
"
  It had been a number of years since I read this and I loved it again this time.  I never feel like Stephen King knows how to end a novel, but the rest of it is classic King gold.  Good creepiness throughout with some moments of true terror.
"
"
  I appreciated the differences between the book and the movie. Steven King is a great writer.
"
"
  Much better then the movie.  Was worth the time to reread after recently reading ""Doctor Sleep""  Stephen King will always be one of my favorites
"
"
  The Shining is the first book I read from Stephen King and I absolutely loved it. The author goes into a lot of different characters and scenarios and in the end it somehow summarizes how Jack Torrance became the victim of The Overlook Hotel. Excellent work.
"
"
  First read this when it was first published - the only book that really scared me. Now, my daughter is reading it and absolutely loves it. The book is so much better than the movie.
"
"
  I enjoyed the book as much as I enjoy the movie. The differences between the 2 are also pretty big - I grew up watching the film so when I finally read the book I was stunned by the differences. A must-read for horror/thriller fans, and moving on to read the book about what happens to Danny as an adult!
"
"
  This is one of the best books I've read from Stephen King. It is amazing. Definitely a great read!
"
"
  The is the 1st King novel I've read. It was great! I loved the writing style. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I've read books that were much more intriguing, probably just a matter of personal preference.
"
"
  This is just an awesome book. It's a little slow at times, but overall amazing. I was excited to read this as I saw the movie for the first time not long ago. The book was SO much better!!!
"
"
  I've read all of his books, and have gone through many copies of The Shining. It is one of his best and scariest. Very easy to get pulled into. I'm rooting for Jack to pull out of his tailspin every time.
"
"
  Book was cut wrong and is unreadable. Missing letters in first 300 pages.
"
"
  Couldn't put this book down...I think I finished it in two days. Readers beware, though- reading right before bed will leave you scared to fall asleep! I'm not exaggerating at all when I say this is the scariest book I have ever read.
"
"
  I liked it when my brother Tom and my sister-in-law Mary said it was scary, but it's still a great book to read.
"
"
  I first read this book in elementary school and every single time I've read it, it has frightened me immensely. In fact, years later, I still find the book just as frightening when I decided to reread it before its new sequel.
"
"
  One of my favorites! I'd seen the movie but never read the book. Even better than the adaptation (of course).
"
"
  I know this is an old book but I never read it or watched the movie although I always wanted 2 and I was not disappointed! So now that I've read the book I gotta see the movie
"
"
  I always wanted to read this book, and I'm so glad I did. Intelligent, frightening, satisfying.  This is so much better than the sensationalism of the movie. Beautiful writing.
"
"
  STILL SCARY, AS THE FIRST TIME I READ IT MANY YEARS AGO. TO ME JACK NICHOLSON IS THE SHINING AND OF COURSE STEPHEN KING'S THE WRITER. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO READ NON STOP THROUGHT THE NIGHT.
"
"
  I like this book because it shines a light on the idea that the world is just a setting for the battle between supreme good and supreme evil. Are humans caught in between these planes?
"
"
  Such a great story!! Truly enjoyable all the way through
"
"
  I loved the movie, turns out the books even better! I really enjoyed reading this book, it's a good scare. Also the book includes some chapters from the sequel, which is always nice.
"
"
  loved it
"
"
  This book is excellent. And a highly recommended read.  It certainly paralleled Stephen King's miniseries in 1997 with minor detail differences.  For those who like psychological horror stories, this would be a highly recommended read.
"
"
  We've all seen the movie, but as we all know the book is always better. I gotDr Sleep as a present, which is the sequel to The Shining and both weAmazing in true King fashion. Thoughly enjoyed both.
"
"
  Wonderfully scary!
"
"
  Great product and excellent company to buy from! Will buy from seller again! Shipped fast and product as expected! Good service!
"
"
  I love scary stories and Stephen King is the master at writing them. The book differs a bit from the movie as is most always the case and the book is always better.
"
"
  I'm a bit late reading this old book, but nothing about it is dated. It's been a complete thrill to read since page one. I've had a few nightmares, which I think is awesome- I have not been given Nightmares by many books.
"
"
  Evil in the most odd of places.  My fourth or fifth time reading one since I first discovered it years ago.  Always great... Though this time, I get to move onto Dr Sleep.
"
"
  Arrived on time and in great condition. I'm very happy with this product.
"
"
  I can see why this book was only 1.99. I've seen the movie and I assumed the book would be better but I just kept finding myself wishing it was over. You don't connect with any of the characters even though you get to experience the book through all three of their prospectives.
"
"
  Of course I do love Stephen King.  I read this way back when it was first published and I loved it then.  I wanted to refresh my memory because I bought the sequel . I was surprised how much I had forgotten (or got confused with the movies). Still a great read, even after all these years :)
"
"
  Stephen King is a true master. I love to read all of his books. I will read Doctor Sleep next.
"
"
  My all time favorite Stephen King book!  I love it!  Must read if you're a Stephen King fan, or if you're into apocalyptic stuff.
"
"
  One of my favorite books of all time.  Hands down, the scariest book I have ever read.  You might want to pull a Joey Tribbiani and put the book in the freezer when it gets too terrifying.
"
"
  Wonderful book don’t know why it took me so long to get around to reading it. Very entertaining. Now I should watch the movie!
"
"
  if you've never read a King book, this is a great book to start. I managed to get away with never seeing the movie and so it was all new to me! this story is hard to put down and will creep you out! a typical Stephen King story-- he never gets old!
"
"
  I enjoyed the book, but I think all the hype made it disappointing.  I was expecting to be frightened.  I finished it more for the suspense leading to the ending, which did make it worthwhile.
"
"
  After years of hearing how good this book was I was let down somewhat. It's a good read but I expected more suspense.
"
"
  Book 3 of The Stephen King Challenge and my third time reading The Shining. There's a reason it's considered one King's very best. It has everything that makes a book great. Great characters that have many layers to them and we invest in. One spooky, desolate location that oozes evil. A nice, tight storytelling that builds tension without filler. To steal a often-used line from old rock stars describing their latest album - It's All Killer and No Filler.For me, watching the overtaking of Jack by the Overlook was the part of the story that made the biggest impact. The man is flawed. He becomes an alcoholic, breaks his son's arm in a drunken rage, loses his job, close to losing his marriage. The man is at the bottom...or is he? Can it get any worse? Oh yes, yes it can. With all of the stress  of the aforementioned problems along with dragging his family across the country in a last ditch effort to climb out of the gutter, all while battling being on the wagon, seems so overwhelming to me. Now, throw in that nasty business of the evil hotel twisting and turning everything against him, and I really do feel for the guy. And that's just one charcter in the story!You'll have to excuse my assumption that you already know the basic premise of The Shining. I won't bore you with reading the same old synopsis. For those of you that don't know anything about the story, I'll let you read one of the other reviews to fill yourself in. All you really need to know that it's simply one of Stephen King's best and most iconic stories and the guy didn't get to be famous and sell a bazillion books in what has always been the biggest red-headed step-child section of the literary field - Horror - by writing clunkers. If you haven't read The Shining, you need to. Not before the end of the year. Not next month or next week. Now. Right now. Quit reading this review and get your butt downloading it or grabbing a copy of it. Pick your poison - eReader, paperback or hardcover. But do it now!5 out of 5 stars and only because I couldn't rate it 6 starsYou can also follow my reviews at the following links:https://kenmckinley.wordpress.comhttps://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5919799-ken-mckinleyhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A2J1JOKW56F2YTTWITTER - @KenMcKinley5
"
"
  Incredible book.  I truly enjoy what Kubrick did with the movie, despite all the criticism.  The book is slow in parts, with almost too much detail.  I found it easy to put down and it took several months for me to finish.  Still, this is a solid King classic and a must-read for any fan.
"
"
  I've been a Stephen King fan for a long time, but for some reason, I never made it around to reading The Shining until very recently. After finally reading it, I now understand why it's so popular. This is Stephen King at his finest!
"
"
  If you like like spooky you'll like this.  I visited the hotel in Colorado where this was filmed so i was curious having never read nor seen the movie.
"
"
  My boyfriend watched the movie and fell in love with it. Got the book for him to encourage him to start reading again. He loves it! GF pints! :)
"
"
  One of the better Stephen King books I've read. Genuinely creepy.
"
"
  Great book great price
"
"
  So much thrilling and fun.You never want to put this book down. It's one of the best books I've read for Stephen King.
"
"
  Ever since reading the Shining I have always wondered what happened to Danny and his mother.  This book explores both physical and mental demons.  A wonderful and a must read for all of us that enjoyed The Shining.
"
"
  This is a great read. It is so much better than the movie and answers all the questions you may have if you have watched the movie. From beginning to end it keeps you involved.
"
"
  I've loved Stephen king for going on 10 years now...and somehow I never read this one. But I wanted to make sure I read this before Dr. Sleep. And as it turns out, The Shining really is one of his scariest books!!
"
"
  Saw the movie years ago, then read the sequel just recently (loved it, too) so decided I should go back and read the original. I'm not a die hard Stephen King fan, but when I do read his books, I love them!
"
"
  I bought this because I also bought Dr. Sleep.  I read it so long ago that I only vaguely remembered the plot line, and most of that was from the movie.  It is one of those books that stands up to the test of time.
"
"
  Excellent story, well written suspense.  The book is as great as Stanley Kubrick's movie version.  Stephen King has followed up the Shining with a sequel, Doctor Sleep.""  Well worth the time!
"
"
  Intense. Great novel!
"
"
  Cult Classic. Absolutely love it. Much better than the movie.
"
"
  While I like the movie, I like the ending of the book better since that is what King wanted
"
"
  Stephen King is a great storyteller.  I saw the movie probably 40years ago.  The book tugs at the imagination.  Great read for anyone that even contemplates the supernatural and doesn't mind the hair on the back of their neck raising up from time to time.
"
"
  I am not generally a horror reader but this book works on so many more levels. The writing is a litlle contrived at times but the overall structure, the shifting point of views, character ambiguities and above all the never ending suspense makes this one of my better reads.
"
"
  For those of you who have seen the movie, it pales in comparison to the book. It's a masterpiece... a classic... and will scare you! lol....  love love love this book
"
"
  Classic Stephen King. The Shining takes you down a road where you know something unusual will happen. You're just not sure where or what until you get there.
"
"
  I purchased this book because i has already purchased sleep doctor not knowing it is a sequel (in a way) to the shining.so i had never seen the movie or read the book.  too much hype surrounds the shining.  I think thats why i was totally disappointed. But I must add that sleep doctor was an awesome book.
"
"
  king has done it again with one of his best. this book will scare you. the overlook has a life of it's own. not a very nice one. the 2 movies were good but the book is much better. if you love to read king then do not miss this one. but read it with the lights on!
"
"
  I'm a huge Stephen King fan and I consider this one of his very best books. There are very few books that actually have the ability to frighten people, and this is one of them.
"
"
  So much better than the movie!
"
"
  One of the greatest horror novels of all time. This, The Stand, and Salem's Lot will go down in history as classics from the late 20th century.
"
"
  Huge Stephen King fan! Read when I was about 13 years old and now I am 51 and didn't fail me the second time.
"
"
  I only read this after discovering that King has penned a sequel to come out later this year (Doctor Sleep).  I can't wait to see what King has in store for us...  The Shining will introduce you to a world where nightmares are not in short supply.
"
"
  This was the first Stephen King book I have ever read and it did not disappoint! I had seen the movie before and I was still surprised while reading!
"
"
  I know King hated the movie and it was difficult not to compare and contrast. The novel really puts the focus on Danny and his special talents.
"
"
  There is a reason why Steven King sells a lot of books: he is an extraordinary writer.  The Shining is a great example of Steven King’s mastery of tension and release. This is one of those books where you find your self speaking to the characters. “No, don’t open that door!”  It’s a real nail-biter all the way through.  If you are new to Steven King, The Shining is a good place to start.
"
"
  Second time reading this book and I enjoyed it even more than before!  Boggles the  mind...twisting, turning, never seeing the end coming quite like it does!  Mr King, you are the master!  Now, on to Doctor Sleep...
"
"
  I recently read The Shining for the second time (the first reading was right after publication).  It was more terrifying and alive this time around.  Mr. King's ability to build an atmosphere of growing terror knows no equal.  I am not a fan of ""horror"" genre, but this was an exception to my rule..just a masterpiece of literature that pulled me in and never let go!
"
"
  One of the best novels ever
"
"
  My only other Stephen King experience was Under the Dome, the audio book and I only got half through it. I am glad I gave it another shot, this is one of the best books I've read.
"
"
  I'm a big Stephen King fan so when I read 'Doctor Sleep' (the sequel to The Shining) I just had to go back and re-read The Shining. I wasn't disappointed. It was even better than the first time. And always, so much better than the movies!
"
"
  Movie was great but they are really two different stories.  If you care about King's vision (and/or understanding the sequel), reading The Shining first is mandatory and rewarding.
"
"
  This is King at his best and even if you have already read it, read it again.  Have you seen the movie, but not read the book?  Read the book.  If you want to read the great storyteller's best, read this one!
"
"
  This is the first Stephen King book I ever read.  It started me on a long journey as a ""constant reader"" and stopped me from dangling my feet over the side at night when I slept and from walking into dark closets.  I actually bought this copy for my nephew, so that he can be warped in a similar fashion!  It is a great book if you like having the crap scared out of you.  It is one of his best and one of my favorites.
"
"
  I read this book because I loved the movie, but they are completely different. The book is PHENOMINAL! Can not wait to read again. Very different than the movie and way better.
"
"
  I was late to this party for sure!  I wanted to read Doctor Sleep but had never read The Shining so I thought Its a good a time as ever.  I don't think I have ever read a book so quickly.  I had hard time putting it down and was totally immersed in it while reading it.  I loved it!!!
"
"
  I haven't read this book in 20 years. I just finished re-reading mere moments ago. I wanted to revisit it after completing Doctor Sleep. It certainly holds up after all of these years but I had also forgotten how much it differs (especially in pacing) from the Kubrick film. It deserves to be read again or for the first time.
"
"
  This was one of the scariest books I've ever read. The last third of it was so exciting I couldn't put it down. I wouldn't read it alone in the dark though, you may never be able to get to sleep.
"
"
  Absolutely love this book and learned things about the story that aren't in the movie.
"
"
  This story really gets inside your head. Different then the movie, but  that's a good thing because there are plenty of surprises . The Shining is just a great classic ...chilling and spellbinding. Things move along rather slowly, but the characters become more defined, building up the suspense for a great ending!,
"
"
  Beautifully written and keeps you thinking, keeps you engaged in the outcome, throughout the novel. Brilliant work, as always, from Stephen King. Highly recommended!
"
"
  a classic
"
"
  Great book!!

  Just like the movie, just more thrilling!  I thought I was more able to delve into his mind by reading the book.  I didn't have Hollywood leading me where they wanted me to go.
"
"
  A great classic. Very well written and I strongly recommend to any person looking for a classic
"
"
  This is one of Stephen King's early books and one of my favorites.  I remember how scary it was the first time I read it and it's just as scary now.
"
"
  Great book that will give you the chills... the movie was great but the book was better!!! Bought this to reread before I read Dr Sleep- would definitely recommend to read together ;)
"
"
  Love this book. One of those that makes you crazy when you read it. Way better than the first The Shining movie.
"
"
  King was right...the Kubrick movie while visually spectacular and creepy doesn't have the psychic horror of the book.
"
"
  A chilling and exceptional book. I couldn't have appreciated the horrors of this title as an adolescent reading King in the same way I experienced them now as an adult. Terrifying stuff that holds up very well.
"
"
  That's what Mr Halloran calls it, but 6year old Danny isn't so sure. And when his father Jack gets a caretaker position at the Overlook Hotel Danny knows they are all in danger.
"
"
  I'm a huge fan of the film and have finally gotten around to reading the book. Although I still love the movie, I really wish that the film had followed the book more closely. The story the book tells is much better than the film...and much scarier.
"
"
  Great Book!
"
"
  Amazing!!! I really enjoy it!!
"
"
  The book was delivered damaged
"
"
  I got to about page 250 and just lost interest, I have tried so hard to like Stephen King books but the only one which I really enjoyed and could not put down was Dolores Claiborne.
"
"
  What a great book, Stephen King is the greatest. I was literally scared and holding my breath while reading this book. It amazes me the fear that can be provoked from reading. On to Sleep Doctor!
"
"
  I read this one many years ago and needed to reread it before reading the sequel Dr. sleep. I loved it even more than the first time. In my opinion King's earlier books are the best!
"
"
  Great for horror
"
"
  This was a awesome book I would recommend this book to everyone. It is a thought provoking book of the supernatural realm.
"
"
  It's classic Steven King, what more needs to be said?
"
"
  Had to re-read this again after many many years.  Still holds up as a classic.  I had forgotten how different the novel was compared to the movie.
"
"
  Came in a timely manner, was a great read!
"
"
  Didn't enjoy it as much on the second reading (first read it when it was originally published) ... I found it much scarier then. Also difficult not to see the characters as they were portrayed in the film. Mainly read it because I want to read the sequel, Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  This is my favorite Stephen King book which was adapted into my favorite Stephen King adaptation, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.  The book and the movie are very different from each other.  The book spends more time with Jack, Wendy, and Danny in the Overlook Hotel and develops them more.  When Jack goes crazy and attempts to kill Wendy and Danny, he uses a mallet instead of an axe.The Shining follows the story of 3 characters, Jack, Wendy, and their son, Danny, so it's easy to get to know and feel for them.  They are developed well and you start to feel sympathetic for them early on in the book.If you are a Stephen King fan, you should definitely pick this up.  If you are a fan of the movie, I still recommend this because there are numerous differences between the movie and the book that I think are interesting.
"
"
  An amazing story, written to perfection.  You just can't stop reading it once you get started, you just NEED TO KNOW what comes next.If your a fan of Kubrick's Shining, know that you won't find the same story in this pages, but you'll sure find some explanations to certain scenes in the movie.
"
"
  The book is slightly different from the movie and more indepth.  It was fun to read I had wondered how different they movie and book would be from one another.
"
"
  Amazing just what you should exspect from the master of horror!
"
"
  His best.
"
"
  Amazing novel worth the buy and super nice for a mass market paperback
"
"
  This was a great book. A lot better than the movie. Way better. I really enjoyed it. I see why king  hated the movie.
"
"
  I love Stephen King and have read almost all of his books. Now that I have the kindle and kindle app on my phone I can reread his stuff. I just wish that they were all $3 or $4. Buying books gets spending when you read as much as I do. And the library isn't always an option.
"
"
  Oldie but a goodie. King is one of my favorite authors of all time. The scene with the hedge animals will always cause chills for me. I believe that was the first scene from a book that actually scared me while reading it.
"
"
  Just like the movie this book was excellent.  Of course the book have a lot more details. Stephen King is always great.
"
"
  Reading the book is so much better than the movie!  If you have seen the movie, (and who hasn't) you owe it to yourself to read this book. There is so much you were missing. This is Steven King at his best.
"
"
  A bit pointless really writing a review on this book.  A SK classic which everyone has heard of and for very good reason.  Probably one of the best Stephen King books ever.
"
"
  Excellent book- much better than the movie.
"
"
  I could not wait to finish reading it
"
"
  It was a great read from start to finish. I liked the cerebral thrills that are paramount throughout the book, although at times the pace did stall out.
"
"
  great book
"
"
  The Shining. What a book! Its everything loved about Stephen King and then some.  Amazing plot, scary settings, gruesome details...Just don't read it alone!!!
"
"
  No complaints.  Audio book accompaniment is well perfomed.  Cant wait to move on to Doctor Sleep book two in series
"
"
  GOT damn masterpiece. And at that, his third book? He’s a great for reason, that’s all I have to say.<U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB>
"
"
  This is a great read for anyone looking for a good intense book.
"
"
  The movie was good, but the book is much better. There is a lot more detail and a very good read for anyone that enjoys Steven Kings style of writing.
"
"
  Stephen king is fantastic and I love the movie
"
"
  Love the descriptions
"
"
  The Shining is one of my favorite books. It's so scary being in that hotel with Danny and his family. And of course all the ghosts. Would recommend it to anyone who likes a good scare.
"
"
  I couldn't help but read this book with Kubrick's movie in mind, and it suffers because of it.On the plus side, the book offers a much deeper look at the characters, and the history of the hotel, and is written with great style.On the negative side, is that the story is pretty obvious, and takes a long time getting to its exciting finish. The movie cuts away a lot of this detail, and seems better for it. I also feel that the movie is more stylistically original, although its visuals have been copied so much in the last 30 years that it's hard to appreciate.
"
"
  I loved the way the story is written.  It is so much more detail than the movie.  Any fan of The Shining should be sure to read this book!  There is always so much more in the book!
"
"
  I first read The Shining back in 1978 and it terrified me.........fast forward to 2014 and I decide to purchase the Kindle edition.  What a wonderful time I had reading it for the 2nd time!
"
"
  I never got around to reading this in my youth but I recieved the book 'Dr. Sleep', for Christmas so it was the perfect time to read, 'The Shining'.  Stephen King never disappoints....great book!
"
"
  Seen the movie countless times and finally got the book to read.  It is a little different than the movie which should be expected and I really liked it.
"
"
  Almost every book by Stephen King is written with such horror and that is good and this book is one of the best one.
"
"
  This is an extraordinary book that should be a staple in a book lover's list of good books to read.
"
"
  This is one of the very few books that really scared me silly.  It is written so well you lose yourself entirely in the book.  It is worth owning so you can read it again and again :)
"
"
  Excellent book. Stephen King keeps you trapped in the plot. You cannot stop reading.
"
"
  Excellent story and very well written. Another page-turner by Stephen King. Definitely worth reading especially if you've only seen the original movie.
"
"
  I've just reread the Shining and the book is so much better than the movie,either version ,although thats true with any of his books that are made into movies.
"
"
  Stephen King just knows how to write a book that draws you in and keeps you entertained. I hated to put it down for any reason, but the worst time is when it was finished. I didn't want it to end.
"
"
  Very exciting and spooky.  Explains a lot that was in the movie but was unexplained.  A first-rate thriller. And the characters are very vivid and real.
"
"
  Just as promised and shown. Will buy again from this seller!!!
"
"
  I couldn't put this book down! So well written, descriptions perfectly depicted, and the story draws you in very suddenly and deep.A must read for Stephen King fans, or any horror/suspense/thriller junkies like myself!
"
"
  You'd be surprised how different the book is from the movie, but nonetheless it was a good scary read.
"
"
  I understand why King was upset about the movie. While a great flick, the movie did not do this story justice.
"
"
  This book will hold your attention from the first sentence until the very end, stringing you along with every word and chapter. It is a great representation of King's writing style and I strongly recommend that you read it alongside his half autobiographical, half pondering book On Writing. The similarities will chill you.
"
"
  Mr Kings works are always worth taking the time to read and this piece is no exception. If you want to experience a great read definitely pick this one up.
"
"
  I have read a lot of King. This was one of the quicker and more enjoyable reads. As a big fan of Nicholson and the movie, it was fun reading the differences and getting a deeper perspective on the characters. Thanks for yet another enjoyable book Mr. King.
"
"
  His stories are ever resonant. The plot just grabs you in the gut and hauls you to the end. I do find myself sometimes preferring these earlier tales. They seem less hurried somehow.
"
"
  As a Stephen King reader who has read all of his books except the Shining, I agree with many other readers,  this one of his best novels. Great story.
"
"
  Have been a Stephen King fan for years!!  I have every book he ever wrote and have just re-read ""The Shining"" in anticipation of the sequel, Dr. sleep, coming out in December, I believe.
"
"
  When I heard the new ""sequel"" was coming out I decided I had to re-read the original and truly enjoyed it a second time!  After seeing both versions of the movie, I was definitely picturing some of the scenes more vividly!
"
"
  Modern horror classic in my opinion. Such an influential book in cinema.
"
"
  Kept attention!
"
"
  I know there should never be a comparison but, I've liked the movie for a very long time and had never read the book. Now that I have I feel like I will hate the movie over how much was just wrong. The book was so much better than I ever expected it would be and I can't wait to move on to Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  Entertaining and strong read. Would 100% recommend.  A genuine page turner with a great storyline.  Couldn’t put it down once I started.
"
"
  Better than the film, if you haven't read it yet, you are missing many details that make the story so captivating.
"
"
  Awesome awesome book! I love the original movie with Jack Nicholson, but as with most, the book is way better!! The remake with Steven Weber is a little closer to the book!
"
"
  A very clear picture of a man slowly descending into insanity. Even if you've seen the movie a dozen times, actually reading The Shining, you will never look at it the same way again.
"
"
  I saw the movie long ago and the book, as usual, really gave so much more. Watching Jack lose his mind was so scary in such a real way really makes this a top King book for me. The movie also robs the brilliantly poetic ending from the book which made it a story new for me. Fun read!
"
"
  Bought this book even though I had read it previously, AND seen the movie.  But with a classic King like this one, one reading in a lifetime is not enough!  Excellent book, prepare to be spooked!
"
"
  Who hasn't heard from Danny Torrance and his dad? Or the Overlook Hotel? So so much better than the film, I can't begin to explain. A must read.
"
"
  What a spectacular reread thus book was.  Every page drips with rich imagery and there are themes woven through the book. What a chilling story this is to read in 2015.
"
"
  If you haven't had the pleasure to read this book you should read it right now. One of Stephen King's older books that has the right amount of terror.  A must read.
"
"
  Loved how king kept you guessing. Also really liked the ending, wasn't sure what to expect until the last page. Interested to see if the movie does the book justice.
"
"
  Don't know how I missed this book when it was originally published. Realized it when I read ""Doctor Sleep"". I was happy to find The Shining was still available. Great book!
"
"
  I enjoyed it. A bit of a slow beginning but its worth it.
"
"
  Super twisted and scary
"
"
  I decided to pick this book up after watching one of my favorite movies ""The Shining"" by Stanley Kubrick based on this book. There are a lot of things that I found strange and unexplained in the movie and I thought 'Maybe if I read the book they will be explained.' I definitely felt that the book was able to go into much more detail, very scary, I didn't want to read it alone. There are a lot of things the book is able to describe that would not have been believable or frightening if they tried to put it into the film. There is also a lot of character description, it really builds on Jack's past with alcholism which really helps you understand his character more. It was a great book.
"
"
  Love! Love! Bought this to read AGAIN! I had lent it to someone and never got it back and did want to read it again. A must read for any King fan!
"
"
  The book is a masterpiece. An excellent tale of a man descending into the madness that the notorious Overlook breeds. One of my favorite horror/suspense novels to date.
"
"
  The novel is way more interesting than the movie.  Though it has a heavy dose of the super natural, it also has a very interesting exploration of the psychological aspects of motivation and jealousy.c
"
"
  Great read
"
"
  Loved this book!
"
"
  I had my memory of this book destroyed by the movie and had to reread before completing Doctor Sleep.This was better than the first time
"
"
  Loved the movie, watched it several times. The book took me by surprise because it has so much more depth to the story than the movie! I would recommend it to anybody who likes the movie.
"
"
  It's a classic for a reason. High schoolers in the future will be forced to read this when the style and content is so far removed from their lives that they can't care even if they tried the way kids are forced to read Shakespeare now.
"
"
  I personally think the book is 100 times as terrifying as the movie.
"
"
  Stephen King is an excellent writer. He is very descriptive and makes you feel like you are in the story with his characters.
"
"
  Now I understand.  Can not wait til next September. It is true that the Film did not do the text justice.  The story is far deeper than a man that tries to kill his family.  I was particularly intrigued at the thread of time travel and continuity of time in the story.
"
"
  I read it when I was a teenager and still stands up 40 years later.  I wish I could write like King does.
"
"
  had to read this again since I've gotten Dr. Sleep and found out the character in Dr. Sleep is young Danny grown up.Loved it 35 years ago, loved it again!
"
"
  Stephen King is absolutely the ""King"" of fiction. His storytelling especially horror is absolutely genius.  The Shining is the epitome of a scary story.
"
"
  Uncle Stevie at his best---the first time I read this, I was afraid to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom for months!
"
"
  A masterpiece of the haunted house sub genre. After all these years, it's still my favorite SK novel, and one I reread when I need some awesome creepiness in my life.
"
"
  I had seen the movie years ago but the book is so much better!
"
"
  One of my favorite
"
"
  not as good as I remember, but worth reading
"
"
  This is the first Stephen King novel I read, almost 20 years ago.  I am re-reading it to reacquaint myself with the Torrance family to better appreciate Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  I have read this book several times & it's always scary & always good! If you have only seen the movie, you are missing out. Read the book! It's great & I can't wait to read Dr. Sleep.  :)
"
"
  Better than the movie ever though the movie was good too. seeing the movie probably took some of the suspense out.
"
"
  Excellent book that kept me on the edge of the seat. Everything was so vivid that I forget I haven't seen the movie.
"
"
  Great interesting twists and turns from the master author of suspense and macabre. King did a super job as usual.
"
"
  Classic King.  Must read.
"
"
  I've been reading old Stephen King novels lately. This i read before, over 10 years ago. It was fun rereading and picking out new pieces I'd missed or forgotten.Great for a fast read!!
"
"
  A great book.  Very visual.  Don't waste your time watching the movie afterwords.  The book is ten times better.  To bad Hollywood thinks they can improve on perfection.
"
"
  Ive read about 46 King novels and never chose this one because I saw the movie a long time ago and didnt think it was that great. I should have known better.The book is ALWAYS way better. I really could not put it down.  Ive burned cookies, stayed up way too late and even tried reading at red lights!
"
"
  Good story. Captivating book. I couldn't stop reading until it was complete. The characters were so well defined, you would know them if you saw them on the street.
"
"
  Like all of his books this one is better than the movie.  Much more satisfying ending.  Looking forward to reading the sequel.
"
"
  So scary..I read at night just before I go to bed and this book just about keeps me up!  I don't know if that's a good thing but, I can tell you it's a good book.
"
"
  Very good.
"
"
  Darker than the film (if that's even possible!) and with more depth of character. Intense and thrilling, much better than the movie!
"
"
  New fan of king's. longer story but frightening. The shining movie Is on my to watch list at the moments
"
"
  Our book club decided to read this in anticipation of reading Dr. Sleep in the future.  I haven't seen the movie so I am looking forward to that in the near future.
"
"
  Most people are at this point familiar with the movie of course, but the book it's an equally impressive experiance, with far more depth to it, than a simple ghost story, it's about inner demons and how people cope with them (if at all), parent-children relations and much more. So even if you have seen the movie a dozen times by now, give the book a chance, you'll be glad you did.
"
"
  Looks good
"
"
  Classic King at an amazing price, what else can I say about this.  Amazon, and Kindle rock, great way to read King.
"
"
  Perfect!!!
"
"
  The film based on this book does  the story such a disservice. I always avoided King's work until I started reading the work of his son. Then curiosity got to me. The book does lag a bit at times, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience.
"
"
  In the film you really only have one thread.  Here several are developed and brought to life.  Wonderful story telling.
"
"
  This book is fantastic. The imagery and symbolism and the crispness of the writing- they all culminate in a suspenseful and horrifying thrill ride, King at his best.
"
"
  Most King (or Kubrick) fans have seen the movie. So you know how things are going to turn out. In the book however, the sequence of events are so much more twisted and suspenseful. For example, Tony didn't scare me in the movie. He's Danny's friend, right? In the book he's extremely creepy.
"
"
  I loved this book. It had a really good story line. I can't wait to read book number 2. Of the shining. Doctor sleep.
"
"
  I love the ending of the book, the films ending wasn't so great. the book is very descriptive on what's  going on within the seen to what's each characters' thought.
"
"
  I thought the book started off slow but the story picked up towards the end and was very suspenseful.
"
"
  King's classic. Forget the movie, though it was great in its own right. This is the real story of the Overlook Hotel.
"
"
  After buying and reading Dr. Sleep, I got the urge to read the shining again, this is one of King's greatest works next to the Dark Tower series.
"
"
  There's a reason that Stephen king is so famous! Eloquently written and he explains the psychological with grace and clarity. I look forward to reading more of his books!
"
"
  I LOVE STEPHEN KING....
"
"
  This is the second time I've read this. I think it is one of King's best novels. The characters are well drawn and the prose and dialogue is great.
"
"
  I read this so many years ago, but wanted to read it again before I got the new book. It was just as good as I remembered. Better, even.
"
"
  Kinda different than the movie, but both were leagues better than the average horror films nowadays.
"
"
  It was nothing like the moving it was all over the place and it was a little had to. Get into
"
"
  AWESOME BOOK CREEPY AS HECK!!!
"
"
  I read this when it first came out, it was good then and better this time. Of course I have seen the movie. the book is :) better. Always is.
"
"
  Glad to finally read the classic. It was worth it. The book goes by quickly and never slows down once it picks up.
"
"
  Still reading it, but it is a very good story.  The book provides details the movie didn't.
"
"
  OMG so much better than the movie, and I LOVED the movie. This is classic, awesome Steven King. I devoured it!
"
"
  This book was not a hardcover as it was listed.
"
"
  This is Stephen King at his best. You absolutely do not want to put it down. I read it when it was first published and it is just as good the second time around.
"
"
  As always, great story- I've had this book for 30 years and I loaned it out. I bought it for $1.99 as part of a monthly deal, and it was great re-reading it, and on a Kindle Fire at that. Something new for an old book.
"
"
  Still a great read and a trip down memory lane. I just finished my second read through twenty years later. Something about King 's world still creeps me out.  I wonder is the thing consuming Jack Torrance the same thing that is controlling Pennywise, IT?
"
"
  Always good to read again - very good story and has held up over the decades - King's best if you ask me ....
"
"
  good
"
"
  I'd recommend this book to any fans of King or thrillers in general. The middle seemed to drag a bit but that was totally made up for towards the end. Now to watch the movie and compare for fun.
"
"
  Very good I hid refrigerator totally awsome here's Johnny and it feels like you are the characters. The imagery is so good you can just see them
"
"
  This is the only Steven King book I really enjoy. Its perfectly written. I consider this his masterpiece.
"
"
  I have never read a Stephen King book before, and the movie of The Shining never impressed me. But this is a great book and SO much better than the movie.
"
"
  Having seen the movie more than once I was ready to read the book. Aside from the maze/animal difference, the book and movie were amazingly close to form.good read.
"
"
  This was a reread from when I was much younger. I have also seen the movie. I had forgotten how much of a nail biter this story is. Awesome read!!
"
"
  Surprisingly different from the movie, in a better way. I now understand why Stephen King was not a fan of the movie, after seeing how well written this book is.
"
"
  I re-read this before I started Dr. Sleep and I'd forgotten my love of SK. It was fantastic and glad I read it again before reading Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  One of the creepiest/scariest books I've ever read.  The quality of the book physically was perfect.  Flawless!  The book?  Kept me awake at night.  Couldn't read when I was home alone.  :)  Stephen King is terrifying!
"
"
  Had me on the edge of my seat! His descriptions just make a MOVIE in my head. I Love it!
"
"
  Much better than the movie.
"
"
  I have seen the Movie at least 50 times love it can Watch it 50 more the book is different than the Movie i liked it has more detail and is worth reading if you like the Movie
"
"
  Finally read the book to lead me in to Doctor Sleep... I'm such a terrible King fan.
"
"
  The Shining was the first Stephen King book that I read when I was in 8th or 9th grade. I loved it then and have become a life-long Stephen King fan because of it.  It was just as good re-reading it 30 years later. King is a master story teller and whether the characters are good or evil you are drawn into them.
"
"
  Scary, entertaining! Great book, I could not put it down. I can't wait to read the sequel and find out what has happened to Danny.
"
"
  Register after reading Dr Sleep.  Still a good read.  I think I`'ll revisit the movie.  I really like that version of the tale too.
"
"
  King at his peak! I am re-reading this for a class I am teaching in the fall on American Gothic. A terrifying read in the past. This time I am struck at the skill in which King uses the family unit and the characters for the anchors for this novel.
"
"
  After seeing the movie and the t.v production  the book is the best way to go. The characters are more defined and you get a better since why the Outlook begins the slow walk of decay becoming a character of the book itself towards the end. If you enjoyed the small screen productions you can't go wrong with the book and will be rewarded for you efforts in this short 429 page book.
"
"
  A classic! I enjoy reading this book every few years.
"
"
  One of Stephen King's more exemplary novels.
"
"
  Stephen King's scariest book is also his best. I am about to start it for the second time. Well worth the read!
"
"
  I don't used to like horror/thriller books until I read this one. I foun myself with sweaty hands and scared to death in the middle of the day while reading it. Amazing
"
"
  Great Book! I have always been a fan of anything by Stephen King.
"
"
  Great book for horror/thriller fans.Having enjoyed the movie in theater years ago - the book was a fun read.
"
"
  Always love Stephen King!! Read this once a long, long time ago and now that the new book has come out, I wanted to rereadthis book before reading the next!
"
"
  Have seen the show many times throughout the years but had never read/listened to the book. Great book, great narration, and alot different than the show.
"
"
  This is definately one of my favorite King books.  Have not yet read everything he has written, but am not disappointed with anything he has penned
"
"
  A good read for Halloween or recovering alcoholics. But I prefer kubricks vision.
"
"
  OK, so I'm a few decades behind here. Of course, I've seen the movie several times, but, though a long time SK fan, I'd never read this particular novel. I'm so glad I finally did!
"
"
  Above and beyond expectations. Has a flow that doesn't falter, even with scenes from the movie flashing through your head so don't be intimidated if you've seen it first. The book holds its own and shines.
"
"
  Love Steven Kings books!!! Read this book when it first came out n reading it again. Always kept at the edge of your seat. Enjoy!!!
"
"
  I've read this book 3 times over the years. Each time it was less scary, but held up as very well written. A classic!
"
"
  King chooses words with skill, selecting just the right turn of phrase to flash freeze a reader's spine.  Throughout the book is the constant drumbeat of coming awfulness, the inevitable collapse of Jack's psyche, the final shattering of familial trust and marital love.  King masterfully threads this uneasiness through every scene, every conversation, in spectacular fashion.
"
"
  In my opinion this is the #1 horror classic of all time.  Most of the time reading it I was in  trance where I was100% with the characters, in the sitution.  Stephen King is clearly one of the best writers ever and this is quite possibly his masterwork.
"
"
  I've seen the movie many times and finally got around to reading the book.  Very scary.  Love Stephen King. I've read a lot of his books.

  This is a wonderful,scary story. Had to pause a little bit to get my nerves together to finish reading it. I felt the absolute terror when Wendy had to find Jack..the fear when he caught her..I haven't been this scared since I read It..Can't wait to start Dr Sleep.
"
"
  Fantastic!! I got the book because I loved the movie but had always heard that Steven King did not like the version that Stanley Kubrick did. I wanted to know why and now I do. While both stories are good, there was so much more complexity and depth in the book that was lost in the movie version (as usual). Can't wait to read Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  I bought this as a gift for my lil cousin but she said she loved it :) And I know Stephen King is a great writer so no worries there!
"
"
  I loved Under the dome, so I figured I'd try another King classic. Wasn't too impressed. It's certainly thrilling, but I kept expecting some sort of twist or Danny's use of the Shining. It's worth reading if you're looking for a simple scary thriller, but not if you're looking for something deep.
"
"
  Before I bought Dr. Sleep I wanted to reread one of my favorite Stephen King Classics. Still holds up as one of the best, scariest books around!!
"
"
  it was so much better than the movie , ready to read it again
"
"
  Loved it. Read it a second time to update myself for reading ""Doctor Sleep"". Now reading ""Doctor Sleep"", what a great writer.
"
"
  I read this when it was first published, so had forgotten a lot of the story. I just reread it because Dr Sleep came out, and it's still a good story.
"
"
  to me it is like a fairy tale of modern times. Yes, it is pretty bloody, but that is also what you get when you read brother Grimm's books.
"
"
  I must say the book is great and really much better than what I assumed was an exact replica in the movie.  Wonderful to read how this turned out as well as doctor sleep which I read first.  R really well done
"
"
  Book good. Very spooktastic. 10/10. Don't accept booze from ghosts.
"
"
  I found it a bit slow mid-way through, but the overall plotline was enjoyable. I feel like I expected a lot more after reading all the reviews about it though.
"
"
  Unfortunately, I read this after seeing the movie. The movie is missing so many important things! And some of the story has been changed! I absolutely LOVE this book! It keeps you on the edge almost through the entire book. Stephen King does not disappoint!
"
"
  A classic and rightly so. Well imagined and well written; and no it does not end the way the Kubrick movie does. I prefer the book,by far. Read it.
"
"
  King is simply a master storyteller. The Shining is required reading before taking on  Doctor Sleep. No further commentary needed.
"
"
  Fast pace and disturbing in a good way
"
"
  But of course I can't because I need to keep reading and if I don't something terrible will happen to me and the lights won't work anymore.Please let me go home now.
"
"
  This is one of Stephen king`s best work, I love his work what great author of his time. Can't wait to read Dr. Sleep next.
"
"
  Great horror!!
"
"
  A classic by the horror master. Love re-reading this. So much more... More creepy, more story, more...Cannot wait for the next book to see how he's grown up.
"
"
  I buy all Stephen King books for my husband he really enjoys reading them.
"
"
  I loved the book and the sequel, too.
"
"
  You wonder what kind of mind write theses thrillers maybe someone stuck in a basement all winter in New England?
"
"
  This book is just as terrifying as I remembered it!  I couldn't put it down. In case you don't know, the book makes the movie look like a nursery rhyme!
"
"
  I live this book but manufacturer threw in the bow with no care.  So it came ripped
"
"
  Read in 2 days because i couldnt put it down, its a far cry from the movie. Enjoy this thriller!
"
"
  Great book. I read it in nearly one sitting. Author keeps you reading. I am now reading the sequel. Buy them
"
"
  It's better and better till the end
"
"
  Great book! Quick read and so scary... Read it in the winter for an extra chill!!! I am rereading this book for a second time and it feels new.
"
"
  I read The Shining in preparation for the new book Dr. Sleep.  I'm a big fan of Stephen King but I'd never read The Shining.  The movie is one of my favorites and I assumed the book was pretty much the same.  I was surprised by how different the book is from the movie.  I really enjoy watching the movie and although the book was not exactly like the movie it was a great read.
"
"
  I reread ""The Shining"" to refresh my memory and to get set up for Stephan King's newest book, ""Dr. Sleep.""  Stephan King is my favorite author. He pushes all of my literary buttons. The Shining was even better the second time I read it. Mr. King does have a way with words.  As a teacher, I am fascinated by Stephan's ""voice"" in writing.
"
"
  I am a recent S King Fan and wanted to read one of his older works, actually to see if I wanted to read ""Dr. Sleep"".  This story did keep me reading but was rather  ""predictable"".  I just enjoyed his newer books better.  I do wonder if I had read it back when it was first published if I would feel differently?
"
"
  I watched the movie before I read this and I have to say the movie is nothing compared to the book. It is a masterpiece!
"
"
  If you've seen the TV series, there won't be very many new elements to the story.
"
"
  No matter how many times I read this book it always delivers a great thrill ride for me!!! It is a classic to me
"
"
  Amazing condition, arrived quickly and packaged well. I had loaned out my copy and lost it, This was a wonderful replacement. Much better than expected.
"
"
  Any fans of King must put this book at the top of their reading list. 'The Shining' contains all the best elements of a true King masterpiece. Also- In my opinion, the movie is such a let down in comparison, it's shocking.
"
"
  Semi decent build up with a pretty decent delivery, I wouldn't reccomend if this is your first Stephen king book.
"
"
  Great story by King that isn't the same as the movie. I find the book better actually. Just buy it!
"
"
  I read this as a recommendation from a friend. Much better than the movie. It explains parts of the movie that didn't make sense.
"
"
  Great book!  I read this after Dr. Sleep and wanted the background, Really enjoyed both books and couldn't put either one down.
"
"
  The Shining is one of my all-time favorite horror movies, but the book is even better at chronicling the descent into madness that Jack experiences.  It scared the pants off me.  =)
"
"
  A story that captivates you from the very beginning and holds you spellbound till the end.  Hard to put down. I'm looking forward to dive into the sequel....
"
"
  First time reader of The Shining.  Excellent, as anticipated. Can't-put-it-down, exciting, thrilling.  ""A must read Stephen King classic."" Now, I can watch the movie.
"
"
  Great book. Still scares me even after the third read. An engrossing, read with the lights on tale. Genius King.
"
"
  Although dated, the story is a very good one.  I actually read it so I can now read the sequel to the Shining....Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  I've enjoyed King 's novels from a much younger age and now that I'm older I see what drew me to him. Suspense, comedic punches, originality, all I find in this books. I read this so that I could have a better sense of Danny and his history as I anxiously wait for Dr. Sleep to be released.
"
"
  This is a great story about family and it's struggles. I've never read King before, but am thrilled that I started with this book.
"
"
  King never fails to deliver, one if his best books. Looking forward to reading dr sleep next when I get a second
"
"
  This is the first Stephen King book I've read so I didn't know what to expect. His writing style is a bit to get used to (like putting thoughts mid sentence) but you quickly get the hang of it. I loved this book and will soon be reading more from him!
"
"
  Seminal classic read that reminds you how movies always get it wrong! Fueled in part by his own demons it shows us a time of Kings life reflected in the prose.
"
"
  Hard to put down, definitely time to watch the film now!! Quite terrifying in the end. Well written really got to know the characters
"
"
  I know it is cliche, but the movie does not do the book justice in any way! character development incredible as always. that is what we come to expect from Stephen King!
"
"
  A great book and masterful storytelling, a true testament to the innocence of a child; and a triumph of the human spirit, the shining takes its reader on a ride through hell and back, if you are disturbed by blood and Gore this novel is not for you, if you are offended by excessive vulgar language this novel is not for you. Now my advice to you if you are not disturbed by those two aspects, read this novel it is a true masterpiece
"
"
  I am not a great Stephen King fan, but have read some of his books. Having seen the movie a few times, I wanted to read the book. I did the same with the Dead Zone. As usual, the movie was great, but the book was that much better. The characters are much better developed and the plot is different enough that I didn't know exactly what was coming next. Very gripping read. I read everything from Science fiction to non-fiction to suspense and technical works so a story really has to hold me for me to continue reading a book. This one did not disappoint in that respect.
"
"
  Great condition. Perfect addition to my collection.
"
"
  Great example of Stephen King mind-twists. Love it!
"
"
  My daughter is a big Stephen King fan, and loved the movie the shinning so we bought her this book as a gift. Good price and delivered on time and in good condition.
"
"
  Stephen King books are amazing. This thriller is a classic and a MUST read! Thank you, Stephen King!
"
"
  Love this book!  One of Steven King's best.  Wanted to re-read it to get prepped for Doctor Sleep.  Worth it!
"
"
  Very dark, yet very true to life horror, much more an essay about human nature than a work of science-fiction. Exceptionally dramatic and sad.
"
"
  The story is interesting and suspenseful. King shows were a person's fear about their pride and status will help push them to wrong and dangerous descisions.
"
"
  It wasn’t that interesting that I expected
"
"
  Great story! Keeps you on the edge of your seat not able to put the book down! The story continues afterward with Dr Sleep! Where the boy is now a grown man, having to face his father's demons..will he succumb to them or prevail against them?
"
"
  this book is so good I though the movie was good but this book is so much better it left me on the edge of my seat the whole time and towards the end. was biting my nails I was so anxious
"
"
  Awesome book. Not scary as much as action/suspense. Great character development.
"
"
  I've read this at least ten times since it was published, and it's still quality King.  Every time!
"
"
  I did this backwards.  I read Dr. Sleep first and then thought it might be a good idea to read the Shining to see what I missed .  Great read!
"
"
  He has written lots of books, some good, some formulaic. The Shining and The Stand are two underrated epics. And the book is far different from the movie. Check it out.
"
"
  I couldn't not it down. Stephen King has this amazing way of writing that keeps readers intrigued and begging for more. Now, on to Dr. Sleep!
"
"
  I thought the book might be better than the movie. It was a little different. It was Fantastic!!  Loved the book and the movie!!
"
"
  Great movie!
"
"
  Plan on reading Dr. Sleep, so I thought I would read The Shining first. Don't know how I missed reading this one, but it did not disappoint. Different from the movie but a very enjoyable easy read. Check out Joyland.
"
"
  Pages are quite thin but besides that it's perfect.
"
"
  A great read kept me in the edge of my seat
"
"
  I had actually never read this one, so when I saw the sequel was coming out, I jumped on it.  It really erased the movie from my memory.  I am now reading and enjoying Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  Stephen King is a genius!I started thinking how I'd never read the book and it had been my loss. So much better than the movie.
"
"
  Couldn’t put this book down!
"
"
  Book was great; even better after reading Doctor Sleep!
"
"
  I read this years ago, but because of the upcoming sequel I wanted a refresher.  I can't believe all the things I forgot over the years.  It was well worth the re-read.
"
"
  The book is much better than the Kubrick movie.  Which was more into the darker aspects of the subconscious.  The miniseries movie was very close to the book.
"
"
  I have seen the film several times over the years and have read the book, The guy who reads this story is brilliant! He is able to transform himself to being so believable as all of the different characters! A very edgy and frightening journey, I was afraid to listen to this at bedtime!
"
"
  I've read a lot of Stephen King but had never got around to this book thinking that it would be similar to the film.  I was wrong. The book is one of King's best works. Definitely worth a read.
"
"
  It was different from the movie,but still ok in the differences in the movie,I read it all and it did having a believeable ending.
"
"
  Kubrick's version of The Shining is one of my favorite movies of all time, but this book is worlds better.
"
"
  My first horror novel since I was a kid. Even thought Robert Kubrick 's adaptation of The Shining is a classic, a movie can never replace the book.
"
"
  I prefer books to the movie translation, and wasn't disappointed. I wanted to re-read it before Dr. Strangelove comes out, & Mr. King doesn't disappoint.
"
"
  obviously, cant go wrong with this one
"
"
  A classic not to be missed.
"
"
  Such a compelling read.  Very suspenseful and creepy.  I had to stop reading it before bed because it gave me really weird dreams.  A must read.
"
"
  Although this book took me a VERY long time to read, I enjoyed every second of it. King's writing is purposeful throughout the entire book and it was definitely the book I needed to get myself back into reading. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a more exciting book and is tied of the teen romances that have grown SO popular.
"
"
  Amazing book!
"
"
  I just loved this book....much much better than the movie..the ending surprised the hell out of me....nothing like the movies ending....cannot wait for part two.... I have already pre-ordered it...just have to wait until it downloads to my kindle...
"
"
  Classic horr or from Stephen King. One of his earlier books; well written and carries you along on a terrifying journey.
"
"
  This book was great to read and I think you will like it. I liked all the characters in this book but it was kind of scary too.
"
"
  Way better than the movie, of course!  I was surprised by the ending.
"
"
  This book was so beautiful written on so many levels! The way each character  was clearly thought through and  developed really made your feel like you were experiencing the girls along with them! Fantastically written!
"
"
  This is one of my favorite of his books so I just had to have it in my Kindle. I also bought Dr. Sleep so that I could have the both of them.
"
"
  Reading this book decades after it was written - still brings the chill to your spine. A time-resistant master piece that tastes better like old wine.Narration of scenes and situations created by the text is vivid, dramatic, and of course chilling.
"
"
  I watched the movie before reading this book and the book is definitely better (and I'm a fan of the movie). King's writing keeps you going with The Shining. A must read if you're a fan of Stephen King!
"
"
  Amazing that this was his second book. If you have only seen the movie do yourself a favor and read this!
"
"
  There are no words, except maybe: ""Stephen King kicks ass, as usual.""
"
"
  Great classic. Predictable though. But regardless, Steven King captivates readers like few others.
"
"
  Haven’t read it yet BUT came undamaged and brand new
"
"
  One of his best, as good today (2014) as it was when it first came out.  Great reading in the middle of the night with the snow falling and a roaring fire in the fireplace.
"
"
  It was a spellbinding book that always kept you on the edge of your seat. I am getting ready to start Dr. sleep.
"
"
  This was one of few times that the movie was as good as the book.  I still loved the book, it was kind of scary and had great character development, and a great story!
"
"
  Book is better than the movie
"
"
  It's The Shinning, what more can we say?  One of Mr Kings greatest feats.  Read it!  Still as good as it was 30 years ago.
"
"
  Way better than the movie. You really get the feeling this guy's been taken over by the hotel, not just kinda crazy.
"
"
  Perfect
"
"
  I loved it! I saw the movie first and decided I had to read the book. How different it is! Great read!
"
"
  I read this book because my mom suggested it. What I really liked about the book was that it was always exiting nothing boring, even when King had to explain something, the words drew me in.
"
"
  Not as tense as I'd expected but a good book. Enjoyed reading it.
"
"
  I'm not a huge Stephen King fan. I did like this book and I liked the book far more than the movie. I also liked that the book was a good length. 400 to 500 pages is perfect for me.
"
"
  The movie was scary as hell, but this is a scary-ass masterpiece of literature.  I'm going to turn around and read it again.
"
"
  Great book and easy read vs many of his other books. Quite a bit of character differences between book and film
"
"
  One of Stephen King's best.
"
"
  What a story.  It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.  I read the sequel, Dr. Sleep, the week before reading The Shining.  Loved them both.
"
"
  I really loved this book, truly. The book inspired me and I learned some important traits to live on. I overall gave this book the specific rating because the book was well written. Also the book was probably the best I have ever read. Good plot, great word choice, the characters fit in perfectly, and the sentences flowed amazingly.
"
"
  Stephen king, awesome book, really had a hard time putting it down. The first movie with Jack Nicholson really follows this book closely
"
"
  I think everyone knows how good this book is, but they keep asking me to review it.  Its real good.
"
"
  An excellent, easy read. Not nearly as long or verbose as many of King's novels. Reread this just in time for the sequel
"
"
  The book is a much better story than the Kubrick adaptation (which in itself is still a great film) I found the book to be better IMO
"
"
  Love Stephen King
"
"
  Sooo much better then the movie and that is hard to beat!
"
"
  Incredible and so much better than the movie.
"
"
  Great Book
"
"
  A classic.  great read.  even better than the movie.
"
"
  Loved it!  One of Stephen King's best books!
"
"
  This is a great classic. A must have for any Steven King fan, whether you have already read it or not.
"
"
  Read it in 3 days - loved it.
"
"
  Big fan of Stephen King. And ofcourse another great book. If you haven't read this one, you should! Love it!
"
"
  I saw the movie when new. This was the scariest book I have ever read.
"
"
  I have been hearing many good things about Stephen King's books so I decided to get the Shining.  I will say that from the beginning of the book, it had you guessing on what was going to happen next.  I was a book, that if you put it down, you could not wait to pick up again to continue reading.
"
"
  Everyone loves the movie, but the book - though some parts differ - is a great read. It gives you insight into the background and thinking of the characters, in a way that is unachievable via a movie.
"
"
  I LOVE Stephen King!!! I have (Now) all his books!! I love the movies too!! :-)
"
"
  Classic and terrifying. Much better than the movie(s). Read it for the first time over 20 years ago, had forgotten what a great read it was.
"
"
  Great read and very suspenseful. After reading the book parts of the movie made more sense. I wish more parts of the story actually made it into the Hollywood classic.
"
"
  Somehow I had never read the shining although have read most of king's books. I really enjoyed it and liked how much the movie (from what I remember) stayed very true to the book. I wanted to finally read it before reading Dr sleep and I am sure glad I did.
"
"
  It was great to discover the book that made King famous. It has all the ingredients that we fans of his love: the ominous ambience, the credible psychological portraits, the multiple details that add bit by bit to the climax, the images that haunt the mind for ever...
"
"
  This book had been around a while, so I'll keep it short it's way better than the movie, it'll keep you awake and make u wonder.
"
"
  Great, gorror classic.  Stephen King is a masterful storyteller, and no one does horror better.
"
"
  I am so glad I didn't see the film,  it was gripping from the start right to the end.The words weird and spooky come to mind.  Not a book for the nervous.Thoroughly enjoyed it!
"
"
  Worse condition than advertised.
"
"
  I am satisfied.
"
"
  I am more than halfway through and it is already amazing from the first pages. Legendary Jack Torrance with the AX!
"
"
  Love it
"
"
  Classic book.  Offered at a great price.  Delivered quickly.  One of those that needs to be read more than once and as it is a classic, paper form is best.
"
"
  Awesome , one of my favorites by Stephen king !!!
"
"
  The book was much better than the movie.  Read The Shining and then read Doctor Sleep.  Doctor Sleep tells about Danny as a grown up.  It explains the problems he has encountered over the years because of his gift.
"
"
  Saw the movies and since there is a sequel I wanted to read the book before reading it.  He reminds us the sequel is on the book not the movie.  Love it
"
"
  Excellent read took a little while to complete it but really good book. Glad I read it you should too
"
"
  A good read though depressing if you hate being snowed in. Reread it in anticipation of the continuing saga of Danny Torrence in Dr Sleep.
"
"
  I needed to re-read it before I read the sequel, ""Doctor Sleep"".  King's older stories hold up after all the years.
"
"
  Way better than the movie. Stephen King is a genius!
"
"
  I've read this book several times....good read.  One of his best stories. Typical Stephen King, twists and surprises that keep you interested
"
"
  Read when I was younger, wanted to re-read again now that I'm older and before ""Dr Sleep"" comes out.......still has thrills and chills, such a well written book.
"
"
  This book is awesome. Though I have seen the movie many years ago, it holds no candles to the book. Very good read can't wait to read the next book by Steven King.
"
"
  Love this book!  Third time I've read it and will probably read it again in five years or so.  GREAT READ!!
"
"
  Mr king does not let you down with this one.  Such a scary tale of being isolated with no help in sight.  A must read fir any King fan.
"
"
  Love this book. I have read it many times. It is one of my favorites. They story unfolds slowly.. the horror builds..
"
"
  Much better than the first movie. Only King's version of the movie was close.
"
"
  I just bought his latest book so wanted to re-read the Shining.  It is the scariest book he ever wrote.
"
"
  Tightly paced and solid characterization. Must-read for fans of horror and thrillers. This book is much better than the movie!
"
"
  It was very interesting and scarey.  I saw the movie, and it was even scarier.  I gave it four because I could put it down and come back later, read some more,  and finally finish it.
"
"
  I bought The Shining so I could reread it before I read Dr Sleep. Stephen King is hands down my favorite author. He rarely disappoints the reader.
"
"
  I have not read much horror and thought that I would give this a try. Its a good read throughout, and the first half in particular I thought was really good. I saw the movie before reading the book, and the book gives you much more backstory on the characters.
"
"
  I'm re-reading it...and Stephen King never disappoints.  Refreshing myself to read Doctor Sleep!  The movie is good too, but you must read the book first since they are different.
"
"
  What can I say? It's The Shining. I kept seeing Jack in the corner of my eye creeping around... good story in any format.
"
"
  Never a dull moment in this book. Captivating from beginning to end. Can't wait to watch the movie again now. It's been awhile..
"
"
  One of Stephen King's finest books. The movie did not do justice to this book. So much more entertaining than the movie.
"
"
  Love it!
"
"
  The book that arrived had a different cover
"
"
  I bought this for my son. it shipped and arrived very fast. needless to say he finished the book in no time. he enjoyed it very much and is wanting more Stephen King titles.
"
"
  Made the movie seem like a joke. Completely different story. Was like reading some else entirely. Was very good. K
"
"
  Convenient
"
"
  Loved it. Read it after reading the excellent Dr. Sleep. Much better than Kubrick's train wreck of a movie.
"
"
  A great book. It's more creepy and spooky than it is scary.If you love Stephen King and you haven't read this book yet, you really should.
"
"
  This is a fundamental work of King, and worth the time it takes to read it.
"
"
  This was an awesome read. I thought I had read it years ago, but apparently I just saw the moviethe book was much better. Really enjoyed it!
"
"
  I read this book, although I had seen the movie years ago, so that I would have Dan's background in my mind.  It was an excellent read!
"
"
  I falsely believed that the movies were the story to this story- but I was wrong. The Shining was psychological horror at its finest. Not much more to say about this book other than it is a classic and I wonder what I ever saw in the two Shining movies.
"
"
  This is a great reading, It makes you feel the desperation and horror that little Danny and the Torrances feel, as I see ti the book is better than the movie, because Jack and Wendy are loving parents, worried, fighting the Overlook, Danny is a brave boy who stands against the horrors that he is able to see... Great read, better than the movie in my opinion.
"
"
  Love recognizing New England places in Kings books, and the shining was no exception..  That hotel is REALLY in New Hampshire!
"
"
  Amazing Book!
"
"
  I was an early convert to Stephen King...I bought 'Salems Lot  when it first came out...I think I was in my 20's or something then...I'm 66 now.  Any way it scared the carp outta me.  From then on I couldn't wait for the next one, then the new one. I was never disappointed. (Well maybe with ""The Tommyknockers and Dreamcatcher) The Shining was up there with Salems Lot, the movie by Kubrick was nothing like the book however, something I think would really piss Mr.King off, I know it did me.However if you want to experience the true fear of ""The Shining"" (and the sadness) you will read the book. Then read the subsequent ""Dr.Sleep"" for the further adventures(???) of little Danny Torrence
"
"
  I finally finish reading it.  This was a great book.  Sorry I read SLEEP DOCTOR first.
"
"
  Never read The Shining, but picked it up after reading Doctor Sleep. What a fine writer King is, and always has been.
"
"
  Stephen King has the amazing ability to take you back to your childhood to relive all your childhood fears. No one else can send chills up and down your spine like he can. Stephen is King!
"
"
  Arrived next day. Excellent condition.
"
"
  Good read after all these years. The ending is much better than how the movie ended. I liked this almost as much as his ultimate classic, The Stand.
"
"
  I could never watch the movie or read the book in the past, but now I can't put it down.  Was spurred to try it with his sequal coming soon.  Love Stephen King.
"
"
  I enjoyed the book. Not the movie.
"
"
  Excellent. Typical Stephen King. Reread due to the new book Doctor Sleep that came out which was also awesome.  Highly recommended
"
"
  Book looks in good shape
"
"
  BETTER THAN  THE MOVIESBEST BEST BOOK YET HAVE READ IT 3x now can't get enough Awesome e books m
"
"
  better than movie by far
"
"
  I've always heard how terrifying The Shining was and I had seen the Stanley Kubrick film, but nothing could prepare me for the masterful, terrifying, and somehow human book. It's a story that gives Stephen King all the respect he deserves and its only one of his masterpieces, arguably the best. Can't wait for the rumored sequel.

  I decided to read this book after I had seen the Stanley Kubrick movie. I felt there were a lot of things that weren't explained in the film, and so I wanted to read the original story to fill in the gaps. I definitely got what I wanted and much more. I highly recommend this, especially if you think you already know everything about The Overlook...

  Typical Stephen King fabulous!  If you enjoy this author, this book is a must read. Now, I have to see the movie.
"
"
  Great book. Love Stephen King! He makes it so real! All work and no play makes Jack a Dull Boy!
"
"
  Great author, and he made me feel like I wasn't the only person who could hear other people's thoughts
"
"
  The story pulls you in and keeps you trapped in the Overlook Hotel with its victims.  Definitely a classic King novel.
"
"
  Never gets old!
"
"
  Enjoyed the book, as ever.  Plan to get Dr. Sleep but time to take a break from King..But I'll return...I always return.
"
"
  read it many times - still love it - absolute classic
"
"
  years later as a re-read.  This is one of those books that prove why Stephen King is the master of horror.
"
"
  This is a great book, I'd forgotten how much different it was from the movie, and that I shouldn't read it while staying in a hotel....LOL
"
"
  Scary and that's what I wanted
"
"
  It's Stephen King. What more needs to be said. I couldn't find anything that interested me so I reread this.
"
"
  No one writes horror like Stephen King. Creepy imagery, compelling plot. He writes about a man slowly going insane so well you'd almost believe he (Stephen) was the one losing his marbles.
"
"
  I like Stephen King, but this wasn't my favorite of his.  I don't know why I didn't read it earlier.
"
"
  I purchased the book after seeing the movie; in this instance, the movie was more enjoyable than the book, which I rarely find to be true.
"
"
  best book
"
"
  This book started out slow but towards the middle to end its like a full on roller coaster. Hold on!
"
"
  Really? You need a rating for ""The Shining""?  Don't watch the movie!  And if you did read the book, a million times better!
"
"
  Scary and great plot but also great character development! Really excellent.
"
"
  One of King's best
"
"
  Most reviewers who are serious about Stephen King will know that the book far outweighs the movie... (even Mr King said this himself -- he was disappointed with the movie)  I re-read this before I read the newest Dr Sleep book and was glad I did. There are quite a few 'inside' jokes, mentions and nuances that are absolutely not in the movie. It's a pretty fast read (if you are a reader) and one that I have re-read quite a few times. The Kindle version is much less expensive than even a paperback version.
"
"
  This book is one of the best books ever written by Stephen King. The fact that it takes place in a secluded creepy hotel makes all the more scarier. This book WILL NOT disappoint.
"
"
  Stephen King never disappoints.
"
"
  Have read The Shining multiple timrs and it still manages to scare me!  Stephen King is a true  master at being able to scare thr dayligjts out of you!  Fantastic book!
"
"
  Again, this product arrived in excellent condition, which is amazing considering the despite the picture here the cover I got was the original which is the reason I wanted it! I also got this item before estimated delivery! Thank you so much for your prompt customer fulfillment!
"
"
  Better then the movie
"
"
  Ok - Good
"
"
  it arrived in first class shape. It was a gift for my grandson.  He seems satisfied.
"
"
  Great book with an excellent writing style and pace. Very scary at times.
"
"
  I read this book because of Dr sleep.  Now I'm ready to start the new adventure of Danny and see the shining has in store.
"
"
  Excellent read. Pretty frightening.
"
"
  For me, this is the greatest of the great in psychological horror. I'm not a complete King fan, but this work is the greatest of its genre, as far as I'm concerned.
"
"
  Can't go wrong with Stephen King
"
"
  scary.
"
"
  Forget the movie, which was okay, and read this book. It is one of King's best, if not THE best.
"
"
  No matter how many times you read the Shining you always get a surprise.  Anything by Stephen King is worth a revisit.
"
"
  Love Stephen King and I didn't get lost in his words on this one.  Great read.
"
"
  A classic.
"
"
  While not as terrifying as some of King's works, The Shining is addictive. Even when one knows how it ends he cannot stop turning the page trying to figure out how it gets there. Masks off!
"
"
  It's a classic, what else is there to say!?
"
"
  This book is classic King a 1000 times better that the movie .. a masterpiece of a complex story so rich in detail and excitement
"
"
  Don't want to put it down King at his finest! The hidden terror in the minds of all of u.
"
"
  Such a captivating tale.  Enjoyed the differences from the movie.  Reading the sequel, Dr. Sleep now!
"
"
  Always loved the movie and hope the book is just as Great.  I ordered the audible for it.
"
"
  Great build up to a very satisfying payoff.
"
"
  Genuinely creepy. This book really holds up through the years. Stephen King is a god :). Looking forward to the sequel!
"
"
  relly good
"
"
  If you have only seen the Stanley Kubrick movie, you MUST read this book. Very, very different from the movie. I enjoyed it immensely and helped me understand the sequel, DOCTOR SLEEP so much more.
"
"
  Of course Stephen King is the best. I read this book over and  over again.Good and spooky.  Well worth having
"
"
  Purchased this book after watching the moving (for the hundredth time) because I wanted more background to certain parts of the story. This is a great read and totally fleshes out parts that weren't explained completely in the film, fun!
"
"
  King delivers a complex story with very interesting characters.  I am never disappointed when I read a Stephen King story.
"
"
  This is a new item but the pages seem dirty and the book feels greasy.  Content of book is good.
"
"
  Classic Stephen King. Had to reread it so that I can read Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  A great read for anyone looking for a great day on a cold mountain jack Terrence is Waiting to enter your mind
"
"
  This book is a classic and I had to read it again. I would definitely recommend this to other readers.
"
"
  As an avid horror buff, you'd think I would have read this iconic title years ago, but the recent purchase of my Kindle just gave me an even greater push. Utterly fantastic; had my hair standing on ends at times, reading faster and faster as the characters hearts were raxing as well.
"
"
  The storyline is sad and unreal
"
"
  Scary thriller set at an isolated snow lodge.  Crazy man and evil spirits.
"
"
  Quite simply put, The Shining is the best horror story I have ever read. It scared the heck out of me.The first Stephen King book I ever read was fire child, it was scary but not too bad. When I read the shining and also watched the movie I was scared for months, this is the scariest movie I have ever seen. And reading the book even made it worse. This summer I visited the hotel where the movie was filmed, it is a beautiful place, however, the movie lives in the hallways and also in your memories for a long time.  Estes park where the movie was filmed is so idyllic, however not sure how winters are up there… Enjoy the ride…
"
"
  Love, love, love Stephen King.  I read this a long time ago, but w/ Sleep Dr. coming out I thought I would re-read it and it was just a good as the first time!
"
"
  A great Stephen King classic.  Decided to read again before I got his new book ""Doctor Sleep"". Glad I did.
"
"
  Stephen King at his best. A family caretakea hotel off season and are taken over by the past.  Lots of scary things that go bump in the night and a liberal helping of murderous gore!Much better than the film. Much!
"
"
  I just reread this story for the third time and I enjoy it every time I pick it up.  Great classic.
"
"
  I enjoyed the book up to the very end. It gave me the chills reading in the dark. Certainly worth the time
"
"
  Love Love  Love
"
"
  Excellent Stephen King book, one of my favorites.
"
"
  One of the original great works of Stephen King.  Very well done and creepy ~ to me, scarier than the movie
"
"
  Way,way better than the movie. The characters are so full of life & surprises, that the plot almost seems like a different story! If you've seen the movie & think you know the story, read the book and be completely entertained, surprise and be satisfied with the whole story!
"
"
  I saw the movie. The book was much better.
"
"
  An essential read for any King fan. Frightening and suspenseful but also heartfelt in describing the depths of a true father-son relationship. I enjoyed it.
"
"
  This is a great book and when I saw the price I quickly added it to my Kindle library.  Waiting for all of his books to get moved to the Kindle.
"
"
  Still as good a read as when I first read it many years ago. Hated the movie! Now onto Doctor Sleep
"
"
  Gift for my son.  He loved it.
"
"
  Love the movie, love the book better.  Doctor sleep is an awesome sequel to this awesome or original.  Hope Danny comes back in a third installment.
"
"
  Good read
"
"
  Early Stephen King what more is needed?  Turn the lights out, let there be no distraction and get ready for the roller coaster to begin.  .
"
"
  Classic Stephen King novel that hooks you in before you realize it. Like many of his books, you will look up after reading a short time only to discover hours have passed and your well planned day has been derailed. Not as horrifying or demented as some, but solidly belongs in the horror story Hall of Fame.
"
"
  A shining review.
"
"
  This book is one of the scariest books I have ever read, but this is to be expected from Stephen King.  Highly recommended read!
"
"
  I have read almost all of King's novels but I feel as if this is not one of his best.
"
"
  Forget what you know about the movie, read the book. I read once that King was disappointed w/ Kubrick's take on the story, now I know why. The book is just beyond awesome, loved it, wow!!!
"
"
  This is the classic Stephen King book.  Any fan knows what that means.  One of his very best books.  A must read.
"
"
  Loved this book. If you are going to read Dr. Sleep by Steven king then this is a must to refresh your memory.  Definitely a 5 star.
"
"
  One of Stephen King's best novels.  Loved it and will read it more than once or twice.
"
"
  Loved this book. I had seen the movie first, and the book is so much better. Definitely a page-turner.
"
"
  Secret sister loved it
"
"
  I just re-read this book for the first time in 30+ years....excellent! Stephen King formulates suspense, insanity, and terror to new heights...
"
"
  Loved every page could not put down and at my age not much scares me but I slept with a night light on since I finished the book!
"
"
  Amazing book.  I reread it before I read Dr. Sleep and it was just as good now as it was the first time!
"
"
  Loved this book. Loves the vivid detail so I could imagine every step of the way. I have seen the movie and miniseries and it doesn't hold a candle to the book.
"
"
  Excellent book. I just wish you had the remake book from the movie that came out not to long ago. It starred Rebecca DeMona
"
"
  I purchased this specific version of THE SHINING because the image specifies an excerpt from the (at the time of this review) upcoming sequel.  The product received did not match the product photo or description, unfortunately.  No big deal, but a little unsatisfying.
"
"
  The Shining is a very enjoyable book that takes just a little to long to get going. However, the final 100 or so pages will have you stuck to the book with chills to the last page!
"
"
  Very good read. Had difficulties putting it down.
"
"
  Stephen King at his best! No weird alien ending that comes from nowhere. Just a well told horror story.  One more word is required?
"
"
  This book was so much fun and made the hair stand up on the back of my neck.
"
"
  One of the best. I'm not a huge Steven King fan, but this is just a masterpiece. Who doesn't like a suspenseful ghost story?
"
"
  read this years ago but wanted to re-read this before the sequel came out. one of my favorite king books.
"
"
  Its a lasso horror story.  To read this and watch the movie right after is a real trip.  Great read if you like horror or thriller lit.
"
"
  After reading dr sleep I had to read the shining as I had only seen the movie yrs ago. I'm so glad I did.
"
"
  Very different than the movie, and very eerie. The author tends to ramble on a few times, but overall it is a very creepy and interesting read
"
"
  Years ago and decided to add it to my kindle library.  Still give me shivers in the most delightful way!
"
"
  Perfect, brand new condition.  very happy with it.
"
"
  One of his best books!
"
"
  I have not read many Stephen King's but this one is now my favorite so far.
"
"
  It's Stephen King!
"
"
  I was terrified, it was awesome
"
"
  Will keep you entertained from page 1 to the end.  Be prepared for a different perspective than the movie.  Highly entertaining read!!
"
"
  An awesome line of characters!It was a very very slow start tho. A few times I wasn't sure if I wanted to finish it.But when it gets good, it gets great! And becomes hard to put down. I recommend reading it if you can get passed the blah stuff in the beginning.
"
"
  This was one of the best books that i have ever read. Could never really get into Stephen King books. So happy that I gave it a chance. Finished it within a weeks time. Best read in a really long time.
"
"
  It was really scary even if I just depended on my imagination, the story just puts it inside your head!
"
"
  Wanted to read Dr. Sleep, but knew I'd have to read the Shining first. Having seen the movie, thought I knew what to expect...but as always the book far outweighs the screen version as the details place you right there along with the characters. Now to read the sequel!
"
"
  amazing!  beyond my expectations....can't wait to see the film finally and read the sequel.  I couldn't put it down once the hotel slowly took on a life of itself.  A true American horror story.
"
"
  I recommend this book to both horror fans and thriller fans. The characters and story are phenomenal and this is an extraordinary piece of work by Stephen King. I haven't finished the book yet, so I can't say whether the ending is satisfying or not but this is really a must-have book.
"
"
  Great book with beautiful narration
"
"
  One of King's best novels ever!
"
"
  This happened to be the first scary book I have ever read, and I was extremely impressed. Way better then the movie.
"
"
  Thrilling and exciting, from the very beginning. Stephen King is a magician who always transports me into the weirdest places of human condition.
"
"
  Oldie but goodie!! Really enjoyed rereading this one. I recommend this and of course think it's always good to go back and read the good ones again.
"
"
  Classic that I finally read
"
"
  Great book and arrived on time!
"
"
  Amazing!!! Must read!
"
"
  This book is a ""nail-biting page turner"".  You will never think of topiaries in the same manner as before reading. Great momentum and suspense.  Highly recommend.
"
"
  Who hasn't seen the movie?  We all have. As usual the book is so much better. I am kind of excited to see the movie again now that I know the thought behind it.
"
"
  Read this book so I would I would be reedy to for Dr. Sleep. Had me on the edge of I my seat a few times. Now I am ready to be scared by Dr. Sleep!
"
"
  There are no words to describe this book!  If you are a Stephen King fan, it is a MUST have in your collection!
"
"
  I've read it a handful of times over the years and it never gets less fascinating or scary to me!
"
"
  Re-reading to prepare for Dr. Sleep. It's been over 35 years and it's still crazy good.
"
"
  I read this book long ago. I saw the movie at least a couple of times.  And like a good friend the most recent reading did not let me down.
"
"
  So great!  A bit different from the movie but better.  I've read it several times and love the movie but recently read it again to prepare for the sequel, Dr. Sleep (which is also amazing).  True Stephen King at his best!!!!!!
"
"
  Excellent author.
"
"
  I heard that this was a must read, even if you saw the movie. I guess I heard right.Classic King Horror.
"
"
  Great novel. Scared the bejesus out of me the first time I read it.
"
"
  Classic!!
"
"
  Love, loved it!
"
"
  Very well written.  The marriage complications they have are scarier and more real than any of the other stuff.  Good book though.
"
"
  Amazing work by King.  Worth reading for sure.
"
"
  I saw the movie the book is way better as usual.
"
"
  Great!
"
"
  If you collect Stephen King, you'll need this one!
"
"
  none
"
"
  King 's craft has never been in finer form.His capacity to drip character development, eke suspense, & drive visceral terror visions is unrivaled.
"
"
  Great book.  Much better than the movie.  Highly recommend.
"
"
  I wanted to read it to see the difference from movie, I liked it better than the movie, but for me it was just alright.
"
"
  Classic S.K. One of his scariest.
"
"
  I have always been a big fan of horror novels, and recently took up reading Stephen King novels. I haven't read much of them as of yet, but my goodness, this book is amongst one of the best I have ever read. It's not your typical horror novel with a typical ""monster"" per say, but in my opinion that makes this story one of King's most chilling tale. The ""monster"" in this novel isn't wearing a mask or living in the sewers - rather he is right next to you and one of the people whom you love. This "" monster"" could be anyone. A beautiful piece that looks at the inner workings of the mind and leaves you wondering that this could happen to anyone. Not only that, it is also a super literary piece as well, as it has a lot of symbolism and writing techniques that can be analyzed. The character development, has to be the best part of this novel however. King usually fleshes out his characters, but in The Shining, each character is beautifully described and fits into the story perfectly. Well worth the read, just make sure you don't read it too late at night!
"
"
  Kings most coherent imaginative terrifying work. Not his best prose.
"
"
  I love Stephen King, all of his books grab you and hold you tightly from the first word to the heart wrenching, terrifying end. Thanks Mr King, for your time.
"
"
  I mean come on! Its Stephen King.
"
"
  Love this book. Couldn't put it down even though I have read it before and of course have watched the movie. Very happy that I purchased it for my new tablet. Otherwise, I may not have thought to read it again even though I already own the book. Definitely like the book better than the movie.
"
"
  Stephen King never disappoints!
"
"
  Perhaps his best work. A must read for King fans. If you've only seen the movie, you're missing most of the story.
"
"
  This was an amazing book and even though it did not have the heres Johnny scene it was a terrifying book and I truly recommend it to anyone who wants to feel a chill or get a thrill!!!! 10/10 Awesome!!!
"
"
  I don't really enjoy reading Stephen King but I like this book.
"
"
  I wont give it away but it doesn't end like the Jack Nickleson movie.
"
"
  The book was in good condition. It took a while to get to my house in Dallas, TX. I would have liked to be informed that it was shipping from ENGLAND!!! I would not have ordered it if I had known it was going to take so long to get here because it was coming from overseas. Please let the buyer know where you are shipping it from.
"
"
  This was my first King book back in the 70s and it is still a good read...as are all his books
"
"
  How can anyone not like this book?!?  Unless of course it creeps you out too much!
"
"
  A classic. Much more detailed than the movie.  All of his books are.
"
"
  Great book! Better than the movie... Isn't that always the case <U+0001F60A>
"
"
  Good price, but I keep find typos in my copy.  Not enough to mess up a great story though.  Blah.
"
"
  One of Stephen King's best! When you read the story comes to life in your mind.
"
"
  Read this years ago; just as good the second time. The right balance of horror and fantasy.
"
"
  Everything as expected
"
"
  haven't finished this book yet(already know how it ends, but still), but so far am loving it! Stephen King is a great writer!
"
"
  thank you
"
"
  Greatest storyteller of all time. His writing makes you imagine hearing a friend telling a story over coffee.
"
"
  Perfect condition
"
"
  This is a classic thriller by Stephen King.
"
"
  Fascinating and scary. This is one that you have to see repeatedly and watch closely. To fully appreciate The Shining we have to see past the horror genre film and explore the labyrinth with Jack, Danny, and Wendy.
"
"
  Page turner...I needed a refresher before I read the sequel. Could not put it down. Really enjoyed this book... now
"
"
  I haven't read this book for along time or not at all. And it didn't disappoint me. I loved it  like Under the Dome.
"
"
  While reading this book I discovered it started off very slow!! Meaning a lot of detail went into the background of the characters and so forth.  It was a great read though and very well written.
"
"
  Finally read this and it was very good.
"
"
  I read this book back in the 70s and I forgot how good it was. Stephen King never fails to deliver.
"
"
  I just love the writing style of Stephen King. I had to reread this book to refresh my memory before I read Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  Much better than movie, and the movie was great!
"
"
  I downloaded this Stephen King book when it was on special for a couple of bucks.  I'd never read it though I saw the movie years ago.  I haven't been reading much Stephen King lately so it seemed a good place to get reacquainted.  After a few chapters I found myself sleeping with the light on.  I'm a writer myself so I spent part of the time examining the style of writing and part of the time getting so engrossed that I forgot to notice the writing style.  This book reminds us all of how well Stephen King does horror.  Can't wait to read some other, more recent releases of his.
"
"
  Great read. A real page-turner, if you need to get yourself lost. This is a good outlet.  While the film is a classic horror film, the book adds a real understanding  of the characters.
"
"
  I absolutely LOVE Stephen King! I've read a run of his books but for some reason I just kept putting reading this one.Well I'm glad I finally got to it. I haven't really read a book I couldn't put down in a while and it was nice to finally experience that again.Love love love Stephen King.
"
"
  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this book. If you liked the movie you will LOVE this book.
"
"
  I'm not a fan of the horror genre; however, repeated questions about the plot of this book from 10 year old left me curious enough to read it, just so I could answer the questions!  I was hoping to find passages appropriate to read to him, but there is nothing in this book for kids.  However, I enjoyed it.  Stephen King took his time showing the mental break downs of the characters that led to the evil, but he pulled me along so well I didn't notice.  I'm now reading another of his books.
"
"
  wings that rock the cradle edition > the scatman axe version.  obviously, I cannot read, but this collection of printed page is adequate.  for a more better book, look at the printed words in the printed word collection Pet Semetary, the feel good story of the 1980's.  listen to my reviewings.
"
"
  Good as described.
"
"
  Extremely well written but man, hard to read. I felt bad for the characters.
"
"
  This is a classic Stephen King and never fails to scare the bejebbers out of me no matter how many times I have read it.  If you are a fan of Mr. King it is a MUST READ !
"
"
  I couldn't put it down. I had seen the movie but the book way better. Very intense and scary. Definitely recommend it.
"
"
  Cheap and Stephen King
"
"
  My son loves the book
"
"
  Of course it's fantastic.  So much better than the movie.
"
"
  One of my favorite books that I've ever read, I've loved this book!!! Great book, one of Stephen King's best!!!
"
"
  Wow! This book gave me many sleepless nights, but man was it great! I love the flow and style Stephen King brings to the table. A must read for any horror genre fan!
"
"
  Thieves excellent. Very descriptive and bold in its suspense and horror. Would love to see this book brought to the big screen staying true to the source material.
"
"
  great
"
"
  Scary. Keep in Freezer when not reading. Even if you have seen the movie, give this a read, in the Summer, in broad daylight, with all the lights on. I mean it! In the DAYTIME!
"
"
  King is the master!
"
"
  Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and this is one of his best books. Much better than the movie
"
"
  Better than the movie. Long and engaging. Read it over a few plane rides. My first Stephen King book, will not be the last.
"
"
  Loved this book,  100% better than the movie!
"
"
  While I really enjoyed the book, this is one of the very few cases where I actually preferred the movie to the book.
"
"
  I think most lovers of thrillers know the reputation of this book.  It's a great read.
"
"
  The master of suspence gives us a chilling story. Sadly, Kubrick exceeded him in every way, changing - but improving - the plot again and again.
"
"
  Read this after reading The Stand, wanted to get into more Stephen King novels. It was quick and entertaining. Love the imagery of Colorado. A good setting is always a plus for me. I generally shy away from supernatural/thriller/horror novels, but this was a good transition book. Not too scary.
"
"
  And it was great.  Love and own a copy of the film but, for those that like the movie, this book is a must read if only for perspective.
"
"
  On of King's best. Much better than the movie and worth re-reading if you read it back in the day.
"
"
  Great
"
"
  Great book! Better than the movie.
"
"
  Wonderful suspensefulIt literally kept me awake...not in a bad way I just could'nt stop reading!
"
"
  It was a good book but I thought it would be more scary then it was I will be reading more books by stephen king.
"
"
  Well read, great story.  Significantly different than the film, so its definitely worth a listen
"
"
  And still holds up now that I'm in my late 40's. I had to read it again before the sequel!
"
"
  I read it because I heard him interviewed on Good Morning America.  I am not a big Stephen King fan and I am still not a big Stephen King fan.
"
"
  I was expecting more.  Haven't seen the whole movie but this seems weaker.  Where were the twins?  Guess I'll have to watch it again.  After all, all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.
"
"
  The way King captures Jack`s descent into madness is chilling. Fun and frightening, I wish they would make a movie true to this story.
"
"
  I know this is an older book but it's refreshing to go back to a classic. Wanted to pick this up with the sequel coming out in Sept 2013. Great story. Still lots of surprises and great to get to know the characters better. Also quick easy read.
"
"
  Love to read Stephen King! Haven't seen the movie, but not sure if I want to now! Really enjoyed this story!
"
"
  I'm yet to see the movie but,I wanted to read the book first because usually the book is better but, this time, I think the movie was probably scarier and there's always so much hype about it. I've read better novels from Stephen king.

  great book!!!!! Steven King is a great author and this book is no different it is no let down a must read!
"
"
  Brand new for great price!!!!!
"
"
  My husband is reading this now and hardly puts it down.  I haven't read it myself but it is great to see him enjoying it.
"
"
  This was my 1st time ever reading a stephen king book but I have to say I enjoyed it, and I've already purchased a 2nd Stephen King book called the stand which I'm lookin forward to starting
"
"
  Idea fantastic, plot superb, exeptionally good handywork.  Much better than the followup - Dr. Sleep.  The best book Mr. King has written.
"
"
  Stephen King is a master at describing a scene.  You can get terrified by the way he lays out the problems for the character,
"
"
  Excellent Condition!
"
"
  I really adore this book.  It is well paced, action packed and of course scary.  Stephen King rolls out an intricate plot that keeps you guessing until the very end.  Overall, a masterpiece.
"
"
  I gave this book a 4 because at some points it was a little hard to follow. I had to re-read some chapters. it was also really freaking scary.. I loved it!
"
"
  Very good book. Kept my attention from beginning to end.
"
"
  Ahead of its time wow
"
"
  The book was fine jut that I thought I had ordered a hardback book. My fault for not double checking the order
"
"
  Great read. I loved the movie version . But I'm glad I finally got around to reading the book. I thought the book was great and surprising all around . Thanks Stephen King!
"
"
  Classic. A lot of people argue over The Stand or It as King's best. To me, I put The Shining right up there with them. Recommended to anyone looking to get into King.
"
"
  Stephen King books are ones I can read again and again. They never get old.  I get lost in his world just as much the second time as the first!
"
"
  I picked up the book because I've enjoyed the movie and thought it was scary. the book is completely different but in a good way. I loved the story and the characters.I'm only giving it four stars because although it was a great book I didn't get the scare that I was hoping for
"
"
  Great book
"
"
  Perfect Stephen King plot and characters
"
"
  One of his best books. A real page-turner.
"
"
  Read this for about the fifth time, still an excellent read. First time readers, you won't be disappointed. Buy now!
"
"
  No one dies suspense like Stephen King. An absolute classic.
"
"
  Fantastic read. It creeps up on you.
"
"
  Classic. A must re-read for ask Stephen King fans. I got it on Kindle  so I'll read it again this summer
"
"
  A classic.  Period!
"
"
  WOW! Amazing read from Stephen King!!!!
"
"
  very good thank you for sending the book to me .
"
"
  A classic!
"
"
  I haven't read very many Stephen King books but it was about time I read this classic. I never saw the movie but have seen shows that replicate it so I was a little surprised by the story. This was a fast read, perfect that I read it on a snow day! The writing wasn't as great as newer stuff I have read but it was very enjoyable. I;m not a huge fan of supernatural stuff so there were parts I skimmed through, like Jack and his hallucinations. I'm now reading Doctor Sleep and am enjoying that as well.
"
"
  my 12 year old requested this on her kindle. she has enjoyed being able to read it at her leisure
"
"
  Love the book
"
"
  This book was way more intense than the movie! A MUST read
"
"
  Loved it.
"
"
  I'm not a huge fan of horror stories, but this one I liked.Also, this is the first Stephen King's book I've read, but it definitely won't be my last! I very much like its style and could relate to all the characters. Definitely thinking of buying Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  I love this story!  It is such a grea haunted house scare!  This is a book I can enjoy over and over!  :)
"
"
  One of King's best books. Scary and satisfyingly disturbing. I highly recommend reading the sequel, Dr. Sleep, after finishing this one.
"
"
  Very good reading
"
"
  I read this on the edge of my seat. Having seen the film, and been scared out of my wits, I picked this up with an idea of the story. The book (as always!) tells the fuller story. Scary. Edgy. Fabulous.
"
"
  Wonderful story, especially fun to read when you're going to visit the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park!There were a few typos here and there in the Kindle edition, but only small errors that you could easily figure out what was intended.
"
"
  Great book.....so different from the movie! Could not put it down! The book makes you feel you are there watching and in the minds of the characters!
"
"
  Classic Stephen King. This is from a time in his life when he was just getting over a lot of the problems he faced early on. I tend to like this stuff more than his current works. There's an edge and a haunting darkness that just can't be found in anything he wrote post sobriety.If you've never read it before, but you're familiar with the Kubrick movie, or you have read it before and you've seen the movie, do yourself a favor and try and push the film far from your mind. I think it makes for a much better reading experience.
"
"
  Still like Stanley Kubrick movie's version better
"
""
"
  Stephen King does it again.
"
"
  It took me months to finish because I was so scared to finish! Beautifully and creatively written. King is incredible.
"
"
  Scariest damn book I've read in a while. Made me cry! Really good.
"
"
  Loved it!
"
"
  My first Stephen King. I was curious about it but am also a huge Kubrick fan and I absolutely loved this book. I definitely recommend it.IMO the book and movie are absolutely fantastic, but as separate entities. The book is far superior in regards to the character development of the Torrence family.
"
"
  Good book! This guy KIng might have a good career ahead of him!
"
"
  Having watched the movies (and ""knowing"" the story) I thought this book wouldn't scare me. I was wrong.Now, I am very much looking forward to finding out what happens to Danny in 'Dr. Sleep.'
"
"
  great book. different from the movie in the best ways
"
"
  Great book!
"
"
  I've read it 3 times now. Highly recommend. Great characters, simple story, wonderfully atmospheric. Fans of the movie owe it to themselves to check it out--they're really quite different.
"
"
  Couldn't put this one down
"
"
  great classic
"
"
  The Shining is simply classic horror that gives acute psychological insight into a descent into madness.  So much better than Stanley Kubrick's vision.  This is a must read for all fans of the genre.
"
"
  It's a really pro read. Like you can see the level of his skill at such a young age. It's great. Plus he makes things that are sort of silly scary and interesting. So yeah, I recommend it.
"
"
  One of his best.  I love it.  I read it about every 5 years just to give myself a good scare!
"
"
  Awesome book.
"
"
  Fantastic
"
"
  Just liked it.It's Stephen King! I wanted to read it, to get to Dr. Sleep.Had I not basically known the story, I would have rated it higher.
"
"
  Loved it! I can't believe I waited so long to read this one. Had me scared I couldn't read it at night!
"
"
  One of the best novels by King, ever. None of the movies shine as bright as the novel. Loved it.
"
"
  Stephen King is a master storyteller, and this one is very spooky. The characters are believable and it's scary. But there is an emotional center that makes me care for each of the characters.
"
"
  had already read this years ago but wanted to read his sequel Doctor Sleep and wanted to refresh my memory on the storyline
"
"
  I could read this book a thousand times. King draws such great pictures with his words I feel like I am right the there.
"
"
  Good read. Spooky. Much different than the movie.
"
"
  Pretty good.  Young and hungry Steve.  I read this at 16 and was very impressed by his technical innovation.  It holds up pretty well the second time around, far better than the movie.  Jack Torrance went crazy in the book.  In the movie Nicholson was crazy from the first scene.
"
"
  Best horror ever written, although I like Kubrick's movie a thousand times more than King's. Great character arcs, settings and action. Insight and dark humor.
"
"
  Love Stephen King.
"
"
  His words flow like a lazy river.  His descriptions are so real one can really picture the scene or event within their mind's eye.  The character development is strong.  The reader can identify entirely with the mind of Jack.  That's scary!
"
"
  Yes. Read this book now. Better than the movie.
"
"
  As always king did a great job. full of suspense. I now reading his new book and it is great also
"
"
  I love this book. I have not read it in over 15 years and it still feels like it did the first time I read it. Definitely a must read for all
"
"
  I couldn't remember if I had read this book or seen the movie since it is an older book. Really enjoyed it!
"
"
  My favorite book. Physical condition was wonderful.
"
"
  So much better than the movie.
"
"
  One of his classics. Incredibly enjoyable read at a great price. Thanks Kindle =)
"
"
  It is an amazing book. Keeps you interested through the whole thing. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the ending. I'm very picky when it comes to those. Definitely recommend!!
"
"
  Finally reading it after all these years so I can dive into Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  Having read most of King's books I finally read The Shining and I can see why it is a classic horror story. The. Characters were very well thought out. The hotel comes across as a character all by itself. I enjoyed the book very much
"
"
  Stephen King has a way of scaring my socks off every time!  This book is suspenseful thriller and heartwarming all at once.
"
"
  Classic King.  His writing is just..  yesss.
"
"
  King certainly knows how to create a hold-your-breath climax.
"
"
  Stephen King at his best!  I first read this book in the early 80s...now I needed to reread before Doctor Sleep...The Shining was as deliciously good today as it was 30-odd years ago!
"
"
  This book is amazing!  Especially if you read it before you watch the movie.  It is terrifying.  I could only read it during the day!  This book keeps you guessing and wanting more.  I could not stop reading it.  There is a twist you wont see coming.  Read this if you haven't, it's definitely one of King's best!
"
"
  Really worth a read!! I never knew books could actually scare you!
"
"
  As a fan of Stephen King, I love this book! But I must say, I liked the movie better. It think because was so extremely different from the movie, which is one of my favorites.
"
"
  It's was a slow going book the ending was pretty good.  I hope Dr sleep is a better book. I would not recommend this Stephen King book for someone to start with by him.
"
"
  Great Buy
"
"
  So much better than the film version.
"
"
  A great scary book
"
"
  A movie simply cannot duplicate a story like this one.  The detail and emotion and creepiness is so much more amplified in the prose.  The movie was good and a commercial success but the book is absolutely worth the time to read it.
"
"
  Love Stephen King's books. The Shining is an amazing way to look at how a place can drive you insane from being cooped up with the same people. The book is way better than the movie.
"
"
  Mind blowing!  So well written and so complex.  Only half way through but I never want it to end.  I stopped reading ""Dr. Sleep"" to read this first and I'm so glad I did.
"
"
  I really enjoyed this book. It was my first Stephen King novel and will more than likely read another. Enjoy!
"
"
  A great King novel.
"
"
  Excellent book. Now to watch the movie and see if it stayed fathful.
"
"
  Loved this book. It was my first time reading Stephen King and it won't be my last. I am a New Englander so I also enjoyed the NH and ME references.
"
"
  This was a good book and a lot of scenes were captivating, but most were very long. What did I expect?
"
"
  All time great trip through King's writing capabilities! Brings you on a journey you will never forget! Classic Classic Classic
"
"
  Classic !
"
"
  This book is great. It scared the carp  out of me. The second book ""Dr sleep"" was great also. ENJOY.
"
"
  If you have never read this, please do so now, you won't regret it, Jacky Boy. Now take your medicine!
"
"
  I couldn't put this book down! I have seen the movie, but this is so much better and surprisingly scarier.
"
"
  I read The Shining when it made its debut.  I enjoyed it the first time around.  I e-read it again in order to refresh my memory before I read Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  I'm sure I will be crucified by King fans for this review but I must say that after having seen the movie a dozen times and after three days of reading this book, I am not at all impressed. I am not a fan of Steven King's writing style at all and although the first half of this book kept me interested, I still found that it was an awful lot of work to get through. I suppose he is known for this now, but it takes King three pages to describe a car ride up a hill during a blizzard. Again, just not the kind of writing style that keeps me or the plot moving along at a fast enough pace to keep focused.All in all, my summation of this book is that it is an awfully depressing story about one man's terrible struggle with alcoholism, his desire to prove to his family that he is really a good man while battling with the ""inner demons"" of his past, in other words, the memories of the nasty things he has done while intoxicated. Then, there is Danny.  A little five year old boy who not only is the abused son of an alcoholic father but who also possesses this awful ability to sense doom and see horrors of the past and future that he must struggle with alone because he cannot share these thoughts or feelings with his parents for fear of them thinking he is insane.  THEN, to top all that off, this family ends up in a haunted hotel. So there are really at least three plots working here: 1) Jack and the lifelong battle of an alcoholic 2) Danny and his torment as he tries to protect his parents and make sense out of the psychic war that goes on inside his head 3)The Hotel itself and all of the weirdness that goes on there (and what goes on there for me, was never all that horrific and actually there are only a handful of scenes that are actually scary. The hedges (okay, enough with the animals moving already), the lady in the tub, the hand in the snow, the dogman in the hallway etc...but for some reason, all of this was just more torment for Danny instead of good scares for me.And finally, the ending is so unsatisfying, so anti-climactic, I was actually searching the pages after the final page thinking, that can't be the end, there has to be more! But alas, it was truly over.I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a realistic, honest account of an alcoholic's mind as he tries to stay sober and patch things up with the hurt he's caused the ones he loves. But to read this looking for a good scare, you won't get it.Also, have you ever realized how many suffering children there are in King's books? Carrie, Pet Sematary, Cujo, It, Firestarter, The Shining, the list goes on and on. He must have had some wicked childhood to write so many stories about children in so much pain. Just too disturbing for me...

"
"
  Amazing amazing amazing! Loved this book!
"
"
  A classic, a must have book for everyone.
"
"
  Very good book
"
"
  Great book
"
"
  I have put off reading this book for years... I am so glad I finally got it.  I really understand King's disappointment with the Kubrick version.....it barely seems like the same story.
"
"
  Love the movie, loved the book even more!
"
"
  Very interesting book and great story line. Stephen King never fails to impress, scare and creep us out! I love it!
"
"
  a classic
"
"
  This is classic Stephen King, from the character build-up to the final conflict. If you are a horror/suspense fan, this is not to be missed. One of his best.
"
"
  Unfortuantely I saw the movie first, but I think this is one of SKs finest. I can' wait for the sequel next year!
"
"
  few books actually get me submerge enough to lose myself while im Reading. this was one of them
"
"
  I read this book when it was first published. I thought it was one of the best scary novels I had ever read. I have been a fan of Stephen King since I was 13. He is one of the best, the reason I say that is, his son. Joe Hill is just as good as his daddy.
"
"
  An amazing read. Imagery is amazing.
"
"
  I have loved Stephen King stories since middle childhood when my mother finally let me read The Eyes of the Dragon. Now I am reading them all. This is a deliciously terrifying story that will make you leave your nightstand light on all night!
"
"
  For a good movie --  watch The Shining with Jack Nicholson. But.....for a better twist on the tale, READ THE BOOK! It is so much better.
"
"
  While I am not a big fan of the supernatural, King is a truly perceptive and skilled observer and writer.
"
"
  Still crazy after all these years.
"
"
  Shipped fast. Nothing is wrong with the pages or anything.
"
"
  Very good as usual with Stephen king books. Always write interesting reading.
"
"
  Long time Stephen King fan, revisited this classic that I had last read some 25 odd years ago.  I was surprised by how my memory of the story, while retaining the highlights and themes, had lost the richness of the story telling.  So glad I made the effort to pick it up once again.  Looking forward to the sequel.
"
"
  I haven't read much Stephen King but I really enjoyed the Shining.  It has been referenced so much in pop culture and has influenced so many works it was great to finally read it.
"
"
  Really good book can't wait to read Dr. Sleep.  You can always count on a good ending with his books.
"
"
  I'm very happy with my purchase.
"
"
  Classic good readLooking forward to reading doctor sleep by Steven kingI don't know what else to say but goodbye
"
"
  Christmas gift...
"
"
  Great book!! Definitely a classic horror story from a great story teller!! Could not put this book down!! A must read can't wait to read the sequel.
"
"
  Read this when I was a teen and wanted to reread! Great book. Make sure to read Dr Sleep after you read this!
"
"
  As I have read most of S.K. books, after reading his newest one ""Doctor Sleep"" I realized I had not read The Shinning, just saw the movie. The book is sooooo much better and to find it here at such a good price was so nice.
"
"
  Kings best
"
"
  As always, Stephen King is a great author.
"
"
  Had never seen the movie or read the book, and I loved it!! Wanted to read it before reading Dr sleep and can't believe I waited so long, probably one of my top 5 king books (after bag if bones and under the dome) Another 'villan' that you dislike from the start
"
"
  I have read many King books, but it took me a long time to get to The Shining. It is a fantastic read. I enjoyed the movie as well, but there is a certain amount of terror that can only be achieved in writing. I strongly encourage anyone who enjoys the genre or the movie to read this book.
"
"
  Loved, it. Really great characters that you become attached to and watch develop through the story. It also sports one of the most interesting antagonists I've ever read about.<U+0001F603>
"
"
  This book I picked out because I had read cujo and had really enjoyed it and I needed to read a book for school (ar) and I was planning to reading doctor sleep. The only thing I have to say about it is that I would read the doctor sleep right after you finish the shining
"
"
  I read this after ""The Sleep Doctor"" because referrences in that book did not match the movie, ""The Shining"".  Boy, did the movie STINK compared to the book.  I really loved this book and am so sorry it took me so longg to get to it.
"
"
  This is one amazing book. It is a little different than the movie, although it still maintained the horror concept.I would definitely recommend this book to my family and friends. It would seem like their type - except for some.
"
"
  I was very bored. Kept waiting for something interesting to happen but it never did. I really like Stephen King but would not recommend this book.
"
"
  This was a great read! I think it took on a different perspective then the movies. I see why Stephen King didn't like the movie for this book.
"
"
  Excellent book. So much of a better story than the movie.
"
"
  You can argue all you want about whether or not the movie was better, but the book still stands amazingly well on its own. And be sure to read it before reading Doctor Sleep - the movie was not quite faithful to its source material.
"
"
  This was  a very interesting book and a must read!!!  Stephen really out-did himself on this one, much more interesting than the movie that was made.
"
"
  I liked it a lot.  It was a great quick read that keeps you on the edge of your seat!
"
"
  Well written, suspenseful story. Kept my attention to the end.
"
"
  Great book so far it explains a lot the movies do not.
"
"
  If you ever worried about your dad doing you serious harm, this is the book for you. Take your medicine, indeed.
"
"
  Kept me interested from the beginning.  Looking forward  to the next book.  Stephen King always delivers a story that keeps you turning the pages!!!
"
"
  What else is there to say about this infamous book that hasn't been said before?I am shocked and appalled at myself for never having read this book up until now.Stephen King at his finest.
"
"
  Love this, I highly recommend this. Gave me some chills, not too frightening but I watch and read a lot of horror. 100%
"
"
  Can't ask for anything better.
"
"
  a must read for any King fan.
"
"
  I loved finally reading the book after having seen the movie many times.  As always Stephen King tells a great horror story and having seen the movie first will NOT spoil the book.
"
"
  My favorite book in the collection.
"
"
  So much better than the movie... Loved how detailed King is in his writing style, and will continue to read his stuff.
"
"
  A great, intense story, depicting how a person can come to madness. Creepy situations that really make you feel the terror and fear of the characters. This is one of the best stories of Mr. King, and a cultural icon.
"
"
  Fantastic book
"
"
  great book
"
"
  Loved every minute of this book.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good scare. Can't wait to get started on Dr Sleep
"
"
  I read this inn the sixth grade I'm now 34. I got so much more out of it and was creepy even more. I'm now going to watch the television series soon.
"
"
  I read the entire novel in four days, three of them were work days so that says how much spare time I spent not able to put it down. Looking forward to reading the sequel, starting right now!
"
"
  Once you read Dr. Sleep you have to go back and read the shining again to see where it all started.
"
"
  Good book. I went back and read this again after reading Dr Sleep. King's writing style has certainly developed over the last three decades: This book seemed a little slow in comparison to Dr Sleep. Although that may be a sign that King's writing style is adapting along with our society's shorter attention span. The movie on the other hand still stands the test of time. King remains one of my all-time favorite authors; but the combination of Krubrick's brilliance and Nicholson's acting resulted in a masterpiece that dwarfed King's storytelling--even if it is his story.
"
"
  This was the best book I read in a long time as a high school student.  I would've given it all five stars if only it was as terrifying as everyone said it would be.  Nonetheless, you need to read this if you want a book that will stick with you.
"
"
  The suspense makes the excitement of reading the book enormous. It is one of those books you cannot leave because you're dying to find out what's going to happen next.I recommend it to everyone who likes horror stories. It really is worth the time.
"
"
  I enjoyed the book from beginning to end. It was disturbing and intense in a lot of areas so it's best to be prepared for blood and Gore, but with a Steven King book one isn't left without those qualities.
"
"
  Excellent book. One of Stephen King's best! It is a book that you will find very hard to put down. Definitely a page turner from beginning to end.
"
"
  If you are a fan of the Stanley Kubrick movie then you should absolutely read the book. I found the book even more terrifying and I look forward to reading Doctor Sleep for more of the same!
"
"
  Way better than the movie.
"
"
  good narrator-good story, kept interest till end. went back and reread the shining afterward. good all around read-recomend highly to everybody
"
"
  Amazing book. Quick read. Great characters. Chilling story. Words words words words words words 20 word minimum words words words.
"
"
  Great read.
"
"
  after reading this my love for the movie and this book have become two different things.  The characters in this book have so much to offer and the suspense is off the hook!
"
"
  EXCITING BOOK.  OF COURSE ANYTHING MY STEPHEN KING IS GOOD.
"
"
  I loved Stephen King's Dark Tower series and decided to read all of his books, starting with The Shining. Fantastic, scary and thoughtful. Forget Stanley Kubricks horrendous movie and dive in.
"
"
  I love the slow build up of jacks transformation and the quick change of gears to suspenseful horror toward the end.
"
"
  Loved it!
"
"
  So far it is a very good book. I haven't finished it yet but as much of it I have read I enjoy it so far.
"
"
  Best book I've ever read all time new favorite!
"
"
  Fantastic!! This was the first Stephen King I read and I loved it. There were many times the hairs on my neck would stand on end and/or I had to look around to remember ""it's just a book"". Great read - could not recommend it enough!
"
"
  It was better than the movie.
"
"
  I am very impressed! I've never read a horror based book before and I thought it would be predictable and boring but I gladly admit that I was wrong! This book keeps you on your toes through the whole ride and is surprising scary!!!
"
"
  I read this book after reading doctor sleep not understanding that it was a sequel to the shining but nevertheless king once again did a wonderful job. The book is slow at first but speeds up and gains interest as the book carries on.
"
"
  A classic psychological thriller. Executed with a cold poise that few others but Stephen King can effectively put to paper.
"
"
  Fantastic in parts, quite dull in others. I was expecting more considering the hype, some of the horror ideas came across to me as quite cheesy. Many may disagree though
"
"
  GREAT PRODUCT!
"
"
  I came back to read the Shining again after finishing Doctor Sleep, just to travel back to Danny's childhood. No other author brings characters to life like Stephen King. His books are just as engrossing the fifth time, as the first!
"
"
  Can't go wrong with this one. Right up there with his best work, rivals both The Stand, It and the Green Mile.
"
"
  Finishing this book during a blizzard was a bad idea.Better than the film, and that's saying something.Wish that Kubrick had kept king's ending.
"
"
  I started reading Stephen King in grade school and have been a fan ever since.  I have all of his books in hard back, but I needed something to read on the go so I purchased the kindle edition.  I will re-read this many more times!
"
"
  Best book. Have read several times.
"
"
  Everyone had said this book was amazing but I simply had a tough time getting into it. I think seeing the movie may have hurt my cause on this one.
"
"
  A classic for sure. It'll keep you on edge from start to finish. It makes me think that there might be a bit of Shine out there.
"
"
  Better than the movie.  I red it because I wanted to read Doctor Sleep and they were related.
"
"
  Very good book!
"
"
  Being a huge fan of the film, I was surprised by the original; though, not in a bad way. The narrator was amazing! Loved it. And I am now on to my next King.
"
"
  Excellent  book, very intriguing.
"
"
  Quality read. Keeps you riding on a suspenseful caravan. King is a master storyteller, and he never leaves you sitting down for long.
"
"
  Really there is no need to write any new reviews. Great book that inspired one of the best horror movies in the history of cinematography.
"
"
  Stupidamente (da parte mia) ho acquistato la versione in inglese. Me ne sono accorta immediatamente e, pecca di amazon, non ho potuto fare ""il reso"". Non avevo la pretesa di farlo dopo 1 ora, ma nei 5 minuti successivi all'errore. Forse sarebbero da rivedere le condizioni per avvalersi del reso anche per questo tipo di acquisti.

  Great as is all of Kings writings

  Great like the rest of his books! I honestly can't decide which one I want to read next. 5 out of 5
"
"
  I <3 Stephen King and this is a classic.
"
"
  Ever wondered if the book can beat Nicholson's supreme performance in the movie?  Read it the original story and meet a supreme writer.
"
"
  A classic. Took me years to actually to getting around reading it. I love the movie, but it does not compare to real psychological fear the book in stills in you.
"
"
  I loved it as I do most all of his books.  I had never read this one as it was from earlier and with my busy life, I have a hard time keeping up with new ones.  Impressed as always.  Glad I hadn't watched the movie. They never do King justice.  Can't wait to read Doctor Sleep now.  I love Danny and am curious as to his future.
"
"
  I love his books. I've seen the movie a few times but never read the book. Even if you've seen the movie the book if well worth reading.
"
"
  Love this book!  It never fails to pull me into the story!
"
"
  Super and awesome.
"
"
  The book is better than the movie, HANDS DOWN.
"
"
  I could not put this book down. First class thriller, one of the best if not the best Stephen King book.
"
"
  Loved re reading this book after years and years of not reading it. It's still better then the Film in my opinion. Now I can gear up to read Doctor Sleep. Mr King can always put you right there to experience the action!
"
"
  Loved it. Though Kubrick did a commendable job with the movie, I feel that the book was scarier and far more gripping.
"
"
  I read the sequel, Doctor Sleep before Reading the Shining, and while I thought I knew the story, hearing it in King's rich narrative voice is not to be missed!
"
"
  I love Stephen King and this is one of his best.
"
"
  Awesome
"
"
  Amazing book, and SK is still the best, whether old or new.. def read it before Doctor Sleep comes out!
"
"
  love Stephen king!!
"
"
  This is the first Steven King book I've read. I was hooked by the third page and simply could not put the story down. It was a fabulous read, filled with unforgettable characters and action that never stopped. I've never seen the movie but don't feel I need to now.
"
"
  I really enjoy King's writing style and this is no exception. Great story and the tiny details always matter with him. Loved it.
"
"
  What a great book.  Of course you can't go wrong with Stephen King or a classic like The Shining.  I could hardly put it down till I was done!
"
"
  This book was great. A little boring at times, but overall I was completely hooked. I would definitely recommend this book to a lot of people!
"
"
  Great book.
"
"
  Product as expected
"
"
  I've read The Shining many times and it never gets old or fails to scare me.  It's a wonderful book to get lost in.
"
"
  LOVED IT!
"
"
  Classic Mr. King. Really, what more is there to say?
"
"
  Incredible book
"
"
  This book gets better and better each time I read it.I believe this is the fourth time in the past twenty years.  The older I get the more I get out of it.
"
"
  One of the things I most appreciate about Stephen King's work is that he creates believable, fully rounded people. I have re-read The Shining at least 100 times, and can do so for the descent of Jack Torrington alone. This one will haunt you.
"
"
  King is King
"
"
  I read this book the first time many years ago. I wanted to read it again before I read Doctor Sleep. I enjoyed it just as much this time around , if not more. It reaffirmed my opinion that Stephen King IS brilliant.
"
"
  Excellent plot line and characters. One of King's best novels. 5 out of 5 stars.
"
"
  This is one of King`s best books. It is so much better than the movie. I could read this again!
"
"
  I liked Stanley Kubrick's version better. The same memories were brought up over and over again, and it just got boring sometimes.
"
"
  Very enticing horror novel, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. I loved how real the characters were made to seem and how attached you were able to become to them.
"
"
  I wasn't sure if I had read this since it was out so long ago. But I couldn't put it down. I kept remembering some the parts of the movie and tried to compare.  But then I realized I needed to focus on the book. It's so much better!
"
"
  one of the best books on writing available and entertaining too.
"
"
  awesome.
"
"
  Really great book! Just started to read it and have gotten a third through and it is really a great book so far.
"
"
  Loved it.
"
"
  Awesome story. Better than the movie.Book is much scarier and captivating than Kings newer books.  I highly recommend reading this
"
"
  Couldnt put down. Had to order one for my daughters collection.  Better than the movie. Got to love Stephan King
"
"
  I like most anything Stephen king writes . I had read The Shing years ago. I wanted to refresh my memory before I read Dr Sleep; which was also excellent.
"
"
  Great story. Of course,different and better than the movie. Still creepy and thrilling. I'm happy I read it and thoroughly enjoyed it.
"
"
  Stephen King leaves the reader flabbergasted, disturbed and wanting more. The Shining has proved to be one of his best novels. I can't wait to read the sequel.
"
"
  I love anything written by Stephen King.
"
"
  Possibly the scariest book ever written. Right up there with The Haunting of Hill House, Turn of the Screw and Hell House. No movie has ever done it justice.
"
"
  D
"
"
  Great book with well-developed and fleshed out characters, enthralling and scary story with some amazingly disturbing imagery that makes you cringe - far far far better that the movie :)
"
"
  GOOD AND NICE
"
"
  Creepy! Was it bad to have imagined Jack Nicholson portraying Jack? Not at all!  Definitely a page turner! Loved it
"
"
  Next to The Dark Tower Series. One of his best.
"
"
  For fiction, my 5-star criteria is how much I look forward to reading more. For The Shining, I could hardly put it down before I was anxious to pick it back up.
"
"
  Classic Stephen King. If you've read any novel of his and enjoyed it, you've got to read this one.
"
"
  I've owned the movie for years and never read the book.  Now I see why Stephen King wasn't overly thrilled with Stanley Kubrick's version.  I still love the movie, but I pretty much look at them as two separate stories with a lot of similarities.
"
"
  As scary as the movie is, this book is a hundred times better.
"
"
  Seriously creepy. I love it.
"
"
  It was more interesting than the movie because you saw jack falling his way into the pit of insanity. It wasn't as scary as it was gripping. A great thriller.
"
"
  Awesome book!
"
"
  Many years later, this is still one of the best horror books I've ever read. I loved seeing how Jack slowly devolves due to the influence of The Overlook. And room 217!!! Fun and scary read!!!
"
"
  Well written great old horror story. Took me a bit to get through but glad that I did! I'll certainly be checking out more of his classics.
"
"
  I have been a ""Constant  Rader"" but this particular book stills  brings terror to ,my  hear. Patty Frtts. ., .
"
"
  Bought this book for a friend. He's normally not the reading type, but he absolutely loves it! Great read, for a Great price!
"
"
  love it
"
"
  Saw the movie. I think the book is better.
"
"
  Absolute classic. A horrifying, heartbreaking tale that stands the test of time . One of Stephen King's all time best.
"
"
  Enough said.
"
"
  Thank you so much!
"
"
  Excellent book.
"
"
  Great book,
"
"
  Scary and excellently written
"
"
  Good book
"
"
  One of the best books by King! Very hard to put down. This is a definite must for horror and suspense lovers.
"
"
  I wouldn't say this is a really terrifying book, but it was thoroughly enjoyable. I don't often revisit books, but I would consider reading this again, a little slower this time to really enjoy it.
"
"
  This book is amazing
"
"
  Loved every page of the book, definitely keeping it to read again and again! And looking forward to the sequel!
"
"
  Well written and thrilling and interesting suspenseful I really recommend it to anyone who likes to read horir books great
"
"
  Gripping
"
"
  If you like being scared then read this book. I still like the Kubrick movie better, but this is worth the read.
"
"
  It's Stephen King! Everything he's ever written is incredible, start to finish. You just can't go wrong. If you read any of his books, you'll be a Constant Reader in no time at all.
"
"
  Never read this a kid. I have always read Stephen King. I was reading Carrie in 7 th grade. Love that it reminded me that places have an evil feel and we can over come them.
"
"
  The Shining is very well written and an instant classic. I am a huge horror fan and this appealed to that better than anything I have ever read. if you are looking for a good read I would definitely recommend.
"
"
  Well written as may be expected from Stephen King.  Captivating reading from start to finish. I have bought the sequel.
"
"
  A page turner if ever there was oneTwisted and enjoyed his twistednessDifferent than the film (very different)Saw the film first. The book was a little better
"
"
  I saw the movie a long time ago but glad I read the book which greatly differs from the movie in all the best ways.
"
"
  good book. I don't think there is anything I can say that hasn't been said before about it.
"
"
  Reasonable price
"
"
  King's book had a much different focus than the Kubrick interpretation of this book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to any fans of Stephen King's books or the Kubrick movie.
"
"
  After seeing the movie several times and because a sequel was written, I read this book once more.  The book, as usual, was so much better.  I doubt, after reading this I would ever be able to stay in an old hotel, in the Colorado mountains in winter.
"
"
  So gripping! Hard to put down!
"
"
  And it's still as compelling as it was the first time. This is not mere fiction. Literature that will last.
"
"
  Kindle version is great some people say kindle books have slight errors, this edition is perfect as I have read many King books on my Kindle
"
"
  Excellent
"
"
  Great book! Thanks!
"
"
  Good reading
"
"
  A well-written psychological thriller. Perfect October read.
"
"
  One of my favorite books. Delivery time was superb. So much more better than the book. If you enjoyed the movie, give the book a try.
"
"
  Not sure how it compares to the movie but I'll find out tonight great October book. One more off the hundreds books everyone be should read!
"
"
  Has always been one of my favorites and re reading it confirms my feeling about the book and Kings writing.
"
"
  Storyline is very well scripted. You know the inner emotions of characters. First time I came to know what ghost thinks.
"
"
  The Shining is right up there with the very best of Stephen King.  I've had the book for years, but put off reading it, guessing it would be just like the movie, which I've seen several times.  It isn't, but both are great!
"
"
  Recently reread this after many years and it still holds up as a great thriller. King is a master at letting his readers peek into the mind of his characters and this is no exception. And with these characters ...well, lets just say that it's a heck of a ride!
"
"
  very good novel
"
"
  Classic old school . ,Stephan King delivers with the Shining, This is one you can read and years later pick up and read again. It never loses its flavor.
"
"
  I loved rereading The Shining as much as the first time 25 years ago! Now enjoying his latest, Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  Entertaining book!  Would definitely recommend it even to those who have seen the movie as they are quite different.This was my first Stephen King read and I will definitely continue to read his works.
"
"
  One of my many favorites by Stephen King! Could read this book 100 more times and never get tired of it.
"
"
  it's just amazing at what this guy can do. I write my self and I will never get up to the skill of Stephen King. I'm moving on to doctor sleep which I've already started and if you liked this you will LOVE this one. and for Stephen- carry on with the books my friend.
"
"
  one of his best!
"
"
  What a great book! Read it years ago but wanted to refresh my memory before I read Dr Sleep. Classic King!!
"
"
  I haven't read a book this captivating in a long time! Talk about suspense. That was the fastest I've read over 400 pages in years haha.
"
"
  This book is one of his best can't wait for the sequel. Let's see what happened to Danny  shall we
"
"
  An early King work, certainly not his best stylistically, but an excellent example of how content, not technique truly rules the literary world.  A twentieth century classic, for sure.
"
"
  I watched the movie a few years ago and just recently decided to go ahead and purchase the book. I was not disappointed. I read it in two days and I feel like I have The Shining hangover. I would recommend this book to literally everyone!!!
"
"
  Read it b/f watching movie if possible.  Learn the characters to make the experience more impactful. Let the book guide your movie expectations & you'll be surprised
"
"
  After reading ""Doctor Sleep"". I knew I had to have the original story.  I have seen the movie and the TV episodes, but neither compare to the book.  The ""Shining"" is a true classic.
"
"
  One of the best books and now one of my favorite books! Classic! Must read! I will be passing this book on!
"
"
  As a King fan I had been meaning to read The Shining for a long time; with the release of Doctor Sleep I finally got around to it.  Awesome book, King does a fantastic job of developing the characters and as always, the plot is twisted and unpredictable.  Definitely a must read!
"
"
  This book was immensely creepy and was almost a little too much for me. Loved the ending and looking forward to reading the sequel.
"
"
  Like all Stephen KingBooks it was good. Better than the movie.
"
"
  Definitely gets in to the heads of the characters better than the Kubrick film. Though I say they're about equally as good as each other. Worth a read.
"
"
  Having seen the movie first, many years ago, helped me envision the main character as Jack Nicholson. Preferred book to movie. A fast read in spite of it's length.
"
"
  GREAT
"
"
  I hadn't read The Shining and still haven't seen the movie. Once I started reading, I struggled to put it down because the story was so good.
"
"
  Sooo much better than the movie.  I'm glad I finally read it.  So scary!
"
"
  Stephen King is absolutely amazing and this is suuuuch a good book!
"
"
  I still hadn't read this one by Stephen King. I'm sorry I waited so long. It was better than the movie and the tv movie.
"
"
  My first Stphen King book and I loved it.
"
"
  A lot better than the movie. I wish the movie focused on Dick Hallorann's perspective a lot more like it does is the book. A good read that added some scare to me.
"
"
  Was a good book
"
"
  Very Stephen king-esque. Very different from movie. Enjoy the read.  Really I am given a word minimum required to submit my review
"
"
  Great book!
"
"
  It's the second time for this book, I still love it. Stephan King totally rocks, no one writes horror like King
"
"
  I enjoyed the book alot. I am a big fan of Stephen King. I plan on reading more of his books
"
"
  I read The Shining as a teenager and remember the joy of being scared at that age by a mere book.  I am re-reading The Shining in anticipation of reading the sequel Doctor Sleep and am so enjoying reconnecting with Stephen King as we both age.
"
"
  Stephen King's books are always GREAT!  This is a great book that you will have trouble putting down.  He NEVER disappoints!
"
"
  A very easy read, I couldn't put it down.I can't remember the last time a book or even a movie spooked me the way this book did.I
"
"
  Actually scary.
"
"
  Decent. I enjoyed some other of King's work much more. I like Christine and Cujo over The Shining.
"
"
  King at his best! Never fails to humanize both the monsters and their victims alike, and truly does give you a reason to have sympathy for the Devil!
"
"
  Great book! Too bad the movie didn't do it justice.
"
"
  Loved it! I almost don't want to watch the movie as I just don't think anything else could live up to this! The creepy images I have in my head.... Mind blown
"
"
  Definitely cleared up some questions I had after seeing the movie.  I loved reading the book and highly recommend it!
"
"
  I read THE SHINING when it first came out.I read it again and got jumpy all over again! you can only imagine all that was happening by reading it!You will always remember REDRUM!!
"
"
  Way much better Than the movie
"
"
  Excellent!
"
"
  Classic scary story
"
"
  My favorite book by Stephen King... I have read them all, but this stands out above all his masterpieces.  Scared the crap out of me!
"
"
  Better than the movie.  
"
"
  Great book.  Terrifying, irresistible, compelling.  It brought tears to my eyes and covers over my head! A definite must read!
"
"
  Amazing!!! A MUST read!
"
"
  This was my first horror novel and i was skeptical of reading horror than seeing a horror movie. But this book as much more scarier than seeing any scary movie. Totally satisfying, hard to put down book. A must read for all the horror genre junkies!
"
"
  This is another of Stephen King 's best. So creepy, scary, and draws me in as if I'm there. I'll never walk past another hedge without worrying if it's watching me.
"
"
  This is my second time reading The Shining and loved it all over again.  Stephen King is #1 in my book.
"
"
  This is my girlfriends fav book. Had to get when she saw King in NY. But like all books if you read it 10years again it's the same! Must re-read if you are looking into Dr. Seep.
"
"
  Good SK.
"
"
  Creeptastic!!!
"
"
  This book is simply amazing from start to finish.It's my first book by Stephen King and I completely loved it.
"
"
  Just finished this, after having read Dr. Sleep.  It'd been years, but each page of this book was masterful.  As good as Kubrick' s movie version was, the book is so much better.  Stephen King, I love you!
"
"
  Love the book! The Stephen king did a great job on the illustration! Such a great witer that I can picture everything as I read it from the way the goosebumps on the character show to the beautiful view of the nghtmareish hotel.. Def suggest this book!
"
"
  This was the first Stephen King novel I have ever read and had the pleasure of reading. Words cannot describe how entranced I became whilst reading this book. It was an incredible experience. I am now hooked on Stephen King.
"
"
  Awesome book! Totally different from the movie and definitely worth reading. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.
"
"
  Love all Stephen King books
"
"
  love it
"
"
  The first time I read this book I was 15. Nearly 30 years later I think I enjoyed it more through older eyes. A masterpiece.
"
"
  Really enjoyed reading it again.  Have seen the movie twice and read the book now three times.  Very scary and spellbinding.
"
"
  Definitely one of the best books I've read in my life!
"
"
  I liked this book a lot more the second time for some reason.  I enjoy everything Stephen King writes.  You really can't go wrong no matter which book you choose.  My all time favorites of his are The Stand, The Dead Zone, and all of his short story collections.  But I will eventually read everything he's ever written, still working on it!
"
"
  As good as anything else you have read by King!Love that this tale will now continue!The shining is real because King makes it real.
"
"
  I was into every second of this book! Dam I was at the Overlook Hotel. I thought the movie was great before I read this book and sorry to say it didn't hold a candle.  ""I am his biggest fan!"" . Lol
"
"
  Enjoyed the tale. Read it after having seen the movie many years ago and again recently. The story was still fresh and urgent and got my full attention. Looking forward to meet Danny in adulthood as Dr. sleep.
"
"
  Awesome! There is a very good reason why this is a modern horror classic.
"
"
  The movie is a stand alone work, so I'm glad I saw it before reading the book. Had I read the book first, the movie would have been a let down. There's so much of story that gets left out of the movie. But the book, definitely a creepy King favorite!
"
"
  The book was amazing. Very different from the movie. Well worth the read. So much detail. Truly inspired me to never watch the movie again. Horrible rendition, no way did justice to the story.
"
"
  What can I say about Stephen King? The book is a creep fest...one of his best. It's a classic.
"
"
  Stephen King is simply brilliant. The book has a very good flow to it and it keeps you guessing till the very end. The book creeps you out, it was almost as if you were present in the hotel. I would definitely read more of his books.
"
"
  Scary. Good. Shining.
"
"
  Read it years ago but liked it better this time!
"
"
  A well received gift
"
"
  Very vivd.
"
"
  As a huge Stephen King fan, I loved this book already, I own the hardback but I wanted it on my kindle so I could re-read it at my convenience.
"
"
  Stephen King never disappoints. This book was amazing and dr sleep was even better i recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a creepy story
"
"
  I confused at times, where I had to re-read the same chapter. But definitely would recommend I.
"
"
  I don't know why it's taken me so long to read this King Classic. It's excellent, as most of his are
"
"
  Unbelievably good read! The master of scare and suspense - this is a classic. EA Poe would be proud. Excellent.
"
"
  Stephen King is one of my favorite authors and this book shows why. Its a creepy story with amazing character and a wonderful plot.
"
"
  Really good! Wanted to read dr sleep but had never read this, nice way  to make a book longer!
"
"
  Just the right mix of scary and fascinating. This is a great book, I can't believe it has taken me this long to do ally read it.
"
"
  I Loved this book, it was so much more than I expected. I feel that it was way better then the movie
"
"
  As always; an enjoyable read. King will always keep you turning the pages without stop. Looking forward to my next King book. Fortunately there is still enough to go around.
"
"
  Read The Shining year's ago but really enjoyed going back.  It now makes reading Dr. Sleep more understandable.  Thanks Steven.
"
"
  Really enjoyed this book. Easy to read and full of suspense.highly recommended. Off to watch the movie now, hope it's good.
"
"
  Don't be like me and read this alone… at night.  Still, I loved it.  I just adore being scared and Stephen King does it every time.
"
"
  Still excellent after all these teardrop!
"
"
  A gripping tale with many spine-tingling, hair raising moments. Characters are better developed than in the film version, making the story more complete and understandable. Now, on to the sequel.
"
"
  This was a creepy book. The movie is well done but this is pretty great also. Check me both out.
"
"
  I've never been a Stephen King fan, but this was a pretty good read. It was much better than the movie. However it was not good enough to make me want to read the sequel. A good read though if you wanted more from the film.
"
"
  E.A.P. would be proud. King never fails to creep out, but the best thing is he does in a way that still seems warm. You still find yourself rooting for the characters even jack.
"
"
  This book was awesome. This is my first Stephen King book I've read and I loved it. The writing style is awesome, and the story itself played around with your head.
"
"
  One of King's best. Never tire of reading it.
"
"
  The Shining has been one of my favorite scary movies for years. Recently realizing I've never read the book, I decided that needed to change. I knew it would be good; but, WOW! Amazing.
"
"
  Amazing book.. it wil definitely l keep you sticked to it from cover to cover and definite surprises...""all work and no play....""
"
"
  I play the ""evil room"" on the pick 3 all the time (movie.)  Imagine my surprise that the book room is different!  Seriously your imagination is so much better than a movie (sorry Stanley.)  Glad I read it.
"
"
  Slightly different than the  movie.  Fills in a lot of details.  Gives alternate ending.  Great companion piece for big fans of the movie.
"
"
  Perfect!!
"
"
  Well written· The characters are amazing. Stephen king's one of the finest books that I have read. Couldn't put down the book.
"
"
  gooo
"
"
  Classic King. The characters grab hold of your emotions and take you for a ride. A must read before moving onto the sequel Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  Love it
"
"
  No one can write like Steven King. This book is always worth a re-read. Will make you always think twice of things that go bump in the night.
"
"
  Intense, really keeps you engaged.  I bought the kindle edition for $1.99 and they jacked up price to $3.73 2 days later. WHY???
"
"
  Still working through the story
"
"
  Fantastic! I cant believe i waited so long to finally read it!!! Remake that horrible first movie and get it right!!!
"
"
  It's worth the read, even if you've seen the movie. More character development, details explained, and a better ending. Great!
"
"
  Great King book, as we all know :)
"
"
  Stephen King remains the king of horror and have read this book a few times over the years! Love it!
"
"
  I was recommended this book by my sister. Overall, this is one of the best books I've read. This is definitely a mature book, and it has lots of twists and turns that make you want to keep reading.
"
"
  One of Stephen King's best!
"
"
  Of course, book was way better than the movie. I was legitimately scared through this whole book. I absolutely loved it!!
"
"
  Stephen King has taken the art of subtle creepiness to a level all his own!  This book is a perfect example of why you should read the book first. The characters are rich and so much more relatable than the movie. Also, the ending is completely satisfying.
"
"
  My first Stephen King book. A great read with great characters. Now onto the sequel Doctor Sleep hoping to be just as great or better.
"
"
  True Steven King fans will agree his books are substantially better than their film counterparts!!
"
"
  Loved it! Stephen King is a masterful storyteller. Can't wait to read Dr. Sleep!
"
"
  This is my first Stephen King book and I'm totally engrossed in every page. What a chilling and ingenious read this is!
"
"
  Got to love the Master!
"
"
  Some how I missed reading this book over the years and revisited it.  Im sure glad I did.  5 stars.
"
"
  I read this AFTER reading Doctor Sleep and, of course, having seen the movie. This was an amazing book. So amazing from start to finish.
"
"
  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than the movie.  This reminds you why Stephen King is the master of suspense!!!!!  The book is so much more in depth and interesting - A MUST READ!
"
"
  The imagery, well developed storyline and twists and turns of every single passage keep you on your heels as you experience what it's like to be young Danny Torrance struggling to keep up with his glorious gift of Shining
"
"
  Classic.
"
"
  I always find horror a tough genre to enjoy. Stephen King is a master of the genre and wrote a wonderful horror book that stands the test of time
"
"
  Tipically Stephen King great detail and imagination
"
"
  I saw the movie years ago and decided to finally read the book. I was not disappointed! The Overlook Hotel is much scarier in the book than it was on the screen!
"
"
  What can I say, Stephen King doesn't disappoint.
"
"
  i ordered a new one and when it arrived it looked like it was used already
"
"
  Realized I never read the book. Excellent read

  Such a great novel. Such a shame that most people will have only seen the movie. Stephen King does it again.
"
"
  I LOVE Stephen King!!!!!!!Have read most of his boks and hungry for more!!!!!!!!!  King is the master story-teller of our time!
"
"
  a.little.nerve racking but well worth the read. it males you realise the world is.not always good to the people sometimes it's a nightmare
"
"
  I love Stephen King's writing, but I had never read this, which is his 3rd book.The smallest details are the scariest. The sound of the shower curtain sliding back in an empty bathroom, etc.
"
"
  The book is way better than the movie, couldn't stop reading. Stephen King has a way with words that makes the book and its characters absorb you.
"
"
  A very well written suspense filled book, that made me not want to go to any hotels in Colorado. But since Colorado is so beautiful I may be tempted to risk it.
"
"
  Amazing book. The character development is super,  King's writing style really is unique.
"
"
  Stephan King is my favorite author.  I enjoy easy reading where I don't have to remember too many details and too many flashbacks and flashforwards and so far with what I have read of his books it is always a good time.
"
"
  a great scare and creepfest of course, but the character development is Stephen King's greatest talent in my opinion. His other books with incredible character development in my opinion are The Stand, The Talisman, 11/22/63.
"
"
  Good book
"
"
  Re-reading before I dive in to Dr. Sleep. I remember loving it as a teenager, and it's still good the second time around. But now, I think it takes a good third of the book to pick up speed; the editor in me wanted to get the action started earlier. Still, a fun scary read.
"
"
  I loved the creative descriptions. great characters who you really care about. the back story before the hotel provides a great foundation for the story.
"
"
  A classic Stephen King that is fun to reread before reading Dr. Sleep.
"
"
  I read it first time as i kid, and it seriously scared me. It's a book that can really make you jumpy if you read it on a lonely night.
"
"
  Here's Johny!Is not in the book!It is awesome!I did not dislike anything!I would recommend this to my Dad And Uncle Burt
"
"
  Love the book
"
"
  One of the most intriguing books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. King is at his finest! I'm looking forward to reading the sequel, Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  Awesome book
"
"
  I really enjoyed the book better than what I thought I would.
"
"
  I love this book!  I just bought it to read again before Dr Sleep comes out.  One of Stephen Kings best!
"
"
  ...that hasn't already said about Stephen King's The Shining. Great read keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you want to keep reading and reading!
"
"
  Excellent book. I watched the movie several years ago, but it does not compare to the book.. Three more words were required.
"
"
  The SHINING is one of my favorite movies.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I could not put down.
"
"
  In anticipation of doctor sleep I reread this book after fifteen years. What a gripping tale. Such an insight into the dark depths of addiction and the whole epic just keeps you rivetted, night after night way past bedtime. Great read
"
"
  A classic of unrivalled character development and imagination. A must read.
"
"
  Great classic book!!!  Love Stephen King!!!
"
"
  anything by Stephen King is awesome!
"
"
  A classic that is still guaranteed to give you chills
"
"
  My first Stephen king novel. Starts good and stays good. Everyone has to read this novel. Just amazing. Read it.
"
"
  EnjoyedAgainAnd read Dr SleepAlso a very good story, granddaughter want to read both books this week, she will.
"
"
  Reread after years, I love Stephen King, he's America's greatest story teller! It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck when reading the scary parts.
"
"
  got this one along with two others in like 3 days...the book was pretty much new...no complaints#goodwork
"
"
  Glad I finally got to finish this book. I started reading it years ago. Now I'm on to Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  I picked this book up again but this time on the kindle to revisit a classic in anticipation of its upcoming 36 years in the making sequel & it still manages to blow my mind.
"
"
  Incredible
"
"
  Finally got around to reading the book after devouring the sequel, not as exciting as doctor sleep but great none the less. The movie kind of spoils it but enough to pull u in
"
"
  Stephen King's genre-setting classic is still worth a read.  If you haven't read it yet, or haven't read it in a while, it will enthrall you for days. Great Book.
"
"
  Great book. Stephen King is a great American author.
"
"
  This book and its characters are greatly dynamic. You can see the good in even the characters that are taken over by evil, the good in a place that has become deadly. A good combination of scary, funny, and at parts, heartwarming.
"
"
  Loved this book. I saw the movie years ago, but the book is much better. Worth the read and investment.
"
"
  I love Stephen King and The SHINING is great!It is a fun and suspense filled story. At times frightening.
"
"
  It was a little slow in the beginning. The latter part of the book kept my  interest .Of course. This was an unrealistic story, which I don't particular enjoy. However, I will continue to read Stephen King's books.
"
"
  I always enjoy reading King, but I always feel like someone should edit his editions a bit more.  If you haven't read the Shining you should.
"
"
  A Stephen King is always a winner. The shining put me in the mood for a good and suspenseful halloween.
"
"
  So much more than the movie! SO much more!!  Very exciting!
"
"
  The ""King of Horror"" illustrates his exquisite talent in this extremely creepy novel. One of King's best works of art. Highly recommended.
"
"
  Perfect
"
"
  great
"
"
  A Stephen King classic novel!  It's got ghosts, murder, a husband who goes insane and a son who has a gift.  If you've never read this book, it's one that is highly recommended.  Some schools have even added this book, and others by King, to their scholastic lineup as must read books.  Be prepared to be frightened!
"
"
  A terrific, classic read from the master of horror!
"
"
  i loved it the first time, i loved it the second time. i loved it the third time.  so i thought i should read it again before i started reading dr sleep.
"
"
  This is one instance where the movie is just as good as the book. The story is just as compelling and intricate as the movie, with just a different take on the ending.
"
"
  I liked it! Definitely a page turner.
"
"
  A+
"
"
  I definitely enjoyed this book. I believe this was a very good choice for my first Stephen king book and can't wait to read Dr. sleep. the ending in the book was absolutely nothing like the ending in the movie which surprised me but in was still thoroughly interested in the book the entire time. Great ending.
"
"
  Stephen king had done very well with keeping you on edge throughout the novel. The build up is exemplary of what a suspense horror novel should have. 5 stars.
"
"
  Was not 100% impressed for it being the first Stephen King novel I've ever read. I more appreciate the writing style of James Patterson.
"
"
  Great stuff.  Seen the movie 100 times, now read the book.  Just wonderful - better than the movie, which was great.
"
"
  I love stephen king very good book for a reasonable price!!
"
"
  I have always been a fan of Stephen King yet never read The Shining. It did not disappoint! Truly a timeless story and one of King 's classics. It fascinated and terrified me at the same time.
"
"
  In true King style, suspense builds over hundreds of pages before finally the climax allows you to breathe again. One of my favorite movIes, I will never see the movie the same again.
"
"
  I had never read the Shining, but had seen the movie.  You really have to read the book!  Even thought the movie is awesome, the book is even better.  So much more to the story than the movie gives you.
"
"
  Good book, and from reading the sample of the next book Dr. sleep, I think I'll be buying that one shortly.
"
"
  A classic.  The differences from the movie are important.  I needed to reread before Dr Death!
"
"
  Another great book by Stephen King. One of the best I've read by him so far. It definitely kept me at the edge of my seat throughout. Great book, definitely worth reading.
"
"
  This book is typical Stephen King. It sucks you in in the first few pages, grabs hold of you and doesn't let up until the very last page. Great story line, unlike some of King 's books, has only a few main characters and is very easy to follow.
"
"
  Stephen King at his very best.  I've reread it a couple of times and it never fails to grip the imagination.
"
"
  Love Stephen King. Wish I had more novels.Can believe amazon has a word minimum. That is ridiculous and stupid
"
"
  Interesting, good story, keeps you wanting more. I like the main characters, they are all a little flawed and complex.
"
"
  It was excellent  the condition  was great I'm very happy
"
"
  Great book.  Kind of creepy, but that's what I wanted.  Definitely worth the price.  I would recommend it to my friends.
"
"
  Still crazy after all these years. What a masterpiece.
"
"
  This Novel by Stephen King I  I e of the best novels. The movie is nothing compared to the great story telling in this novel.
"
"
  Great book, well paced and thoughtful characters. Highly recommend this book. I dont have any thing else to say done
"
"
  Different than the movie, but so much better.
"
"
  Stephen King is right up there with Dickens & Shakespeare, what else can I say!
"
"
  Excellent book
"
"
  It's a really great book. Scary, even though I read it after reading Dr. Sleep.  One of King's best works.
"
"
  Loved it! Wish I had read it years ago and not just relied on the movie's version of the story.
"
"
  Excellent book. The movie was not as entertaining as the novel. Stephen King is a great horror writer and very creative.
"
"
  Loved it. The best of Stephen king. Just finished it and I want to read it again. I can't praise this Novel more
"
"
  Entertaining read, a masterpiece !
"
"
  Loved this book.
"
"
  Outstanding it kept me reading and could not put it down amazing then to read book #2 Sleep Doctor was wow... Wish there was a third
"
"
  Steven king is such a great author and he writes with such detail. This book has a complicated but great plot.
"
"
  Classic King. He doesn't disappoint.
"
"
  Stephen King is awesome and I will give all his books 5 stars no matter what with It being my favorite book!!
"
"
  Some moments of brilliant insight into the mind of a sociopath who is also an alcoholic. Scary stuff.
"
"
  And the master of human behavior. And the master of narrative. Yes, I am a huge fan. I first read this book decades ago and I think I enjoyed it more this time. I can't wait for the sequel.
"
"
  Perfect. Great book. Better than the movie.
"
"
  This book is really good Steven King is an awesome writer always leaving you In suspense. I really like this book it's very different from the movie in some ways. But it's good.
"
"
  I wasn't even born when this book came out but I thought I would give it a shot.  I'm so glad I did.  I have now decided that I will read every Stephen King book.
"
"
  Great Stephen King novel.  Well written, good characters, plot and storyline.  Made an excellent movie with Nicholson in the lead.
"
"
  Great classic. Saw the movie a bunch of times but never read the book. Definitely a good read, some things in the book that are not in the movie.
"
"
  The book is amazing so far and I'm about half way through. The reason for 3 stars, half a page is cut off on 1 page so far. Hoping it's only the one page.
"
"
  Much better than the movies, you owe it to yourself to read this book. A steal at $1.99, I loved it
"
"
  Great book
"
"
  The book is entertaining to read and very absorbing. The words are vivid and descriptive. And the thrill is real!
"
"
  The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The characters are relateable and interesting.  Nobody can weave a story quite like Stephen King. His underlying themes and plot twists are riveting. I cannot wait to read his sequel.
"
"
  A classic!
"
"
  I love this book, it is one of the scariest horror books I have ever read and will definitely creep you out. The writing is very good, and I would recommend it to anyone.
"
"
  reread this so its fresh in my mind for the sequel. liked it just as much as the first time i read it years ago and still my fav king book
"
"
  Item as described. Fast shopping. A+
"
"
  Still reading it...my second time around!  Huge fan of Stephen King!
"
"
  One of his best novels.  Very different from the Kubrick movie, so you can enjoy the book even if you are familiar with the movie.
"
"
  Reread this one before starting his new book, Dr. Sleep.  One of Mr. King's best. Can't wait to get started on the new one to find out what has been going on in Danny Torrance's life.
"
"
  Riveting and well written. Looking forward to the sequel
"
"
  If you love the movie, you'll LOVE this novel. The novel is more scary than the movie ever thought about being. Awesome.
"
"
  went back and re-read this after reading Dr. Sleep.  it is just as good as I remember! I highly recommend.
"
"
  Had nightmares after reading. Definitely gripping enough!
"
"
  Great book. Was fun to picture Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance. Was also different enough from the movie to keep things interesting.
"
"
  Love the book. Came in perfect condition. Way better than the movie.
"
"
  An excellent story! Everything from A to Z is the landmark of a genius writer! I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read...
"
"
  Great reading; very scary.  Love Stephen King. Enjoyed the movie but the book is even better. Recommend the book highly.
"
"
  Was one of my better reads in a while. King is a masterful story teller that keeps you turning the pages. Would recommend this read to anyone over the age of 18. Fantastic thriller!
"
"
  I have read it more than once and enjoy the wonderful story telling each time.
"
"
  Had spooks, Gore, and a captivating story line. Stephen King is a master at what he does and this particular piece of art is one that will remain timeless.
"
"
  If you've seen Kubrick's movie...forget all of it. Prepare yourself for an enthralling adventure through the overlook hotel like you've never imagined before...
"
"
  I read this book when it was first published and decided to try it again, still a great book.
"
"
  A slow read for me.
"
"
  The begging is long the first chunk is exciting. The middle is a long haul of nothing. But then it all just hits. Please read this book.
"
"
  Great book can't wait to read doctor sleep. Danny Torrance is a great character. Also loved dick holloran. A must read
"
"
  It's good to go back and read the old stuff. A must read before d.r  sleep. Stephen king at his best.
"
"
  Long but interesting.
"
"
  Don't normally read Stephen King or 'Horror', but read this on a whim and it was brilliant and absorbing. Amazing how a book can create such atmosphere and tension.
"
"
  Great read!  So much deeper than the movie......but aren't all books?
"
"
  It's as classic King as you can get! I actually re-read it as the prelude to Dr.Sleep. I had forgotten how much better than the movie the book was!
"
"
  <U+0001F600><U+0001F600>
"
"
  Always a King fan. This story is as good the second and third time as it is the first! Recommend.
"
"
  I thought I could never be scared of a book. I was mistaken. King paints the perfect picture for this horror story. I will now be visiting Colorado to visit the hotel that inspired this book. Brilliant!
"
"
  Good story...longer set up than I would have liked. It was tough to stick with it through the slower chapters, but I am glad I did.
"
"
  Great book!  Draws you in from the very beginning and keeps you in suspense until the very end.  If you only saw the movie, I highly recommend reading the book!
"
"
  It took me a long time to get around to reading The Shining, but once I started I couldn't put my kindle down.Superbly written and one of King's less eccentric novels. Absolutely 100% worth reading.
"
"
  Absolutely terrifying! The movie did the book no justice. So good and a classic must read! I couldn't put it down!
"
"
  Not bad, certainly spooky towards the end. A very slow build. I didn't love it by any means but I can check it off my list.
"
"
  I have read many Stephen King books, but for some reason hadn't read The Shining yet. Glad i finally picked it up. This story will definitely give you chills and might even make you see things in dark hallways...
"
"
  The book is def a mind thriller. Reading it in church is not a good idea though.  It has some parts that could have been tightened up but the book in whole is excellent.
"
"
  always wanted to read the book
"
"
  Intense and thrilling. One of Mr. King's best works. I'll definitely be adding the physical copy to my collection as well.
"
"
  Not a fan at all of Stephen King's writing. The first like 350 pages was boring, useless information. Once some of the horror starts, it's very slow and written in a nonchalant way that its not even suspenseful. There are so many flashbacks and repeated things that could be taken out and make the book about 400 pages shorter.
"
"
  Classic  King.  This is a must read if you're going to read  Dr.  Sleep.  catch up with the characters  and location from  the Overlook  hotel.
"
"
  First Stephen King book I've read, I am addicted after the first three chapters. Definitely a must read. Scary as hell.
"
"
  first time read this and it was great.  Now going to read the sequel.  hope it is just as much a page turner
"
"
  Classic.
"
"
  I recently read King's book, Dr Sleep, which I enjoyed, so decided to read The Shinning, which he wrote years ago. Wanted to go back and learn more about Danny or doc. Enjoyed The Shinning too.
"
"
  the cover and pages was slightly bent, but not to bad.the packaging did not look very secure.i would still recommend the product.
"
"
  skillfully written. you can actually feel the hotel coming to life, coming for you. first stephen king novel I ever read. think i'll kep on reading. =D
"
"
  Great story telling and great character development. I loved how he changed the narration's voice in the character chapters.  I would recommend this book to even non horror lovers.
"
"
  I definitely enjoyed reading this book and would recommend. I saw the movie a while back and it left out so many details.
"
"
  It was great. Suspenseful and well written. A classic stephen king novel
"
"
  A classic. One of Stephen King's best.
"
"
  Great character development here with psychological pain and family ties. King really gets in the mind of his victims and the terror feels real. I recommend this to any horror fan
"
"
  You cannot deny that Stephen King wrote a master piece with 'the Shining'. Read the book years ago and started re-reading it now. It's still as fantastic as when I first read it..
"
"
  I could read this book over and over again!! Scary as hell. I'm hooked on Danny Torrence. Time to read Dr. sleep!
"
"
  Can't get much better than King. I feel like I can never get enough of his books. Worth the read, very different from the movie.
"
"
  Genius.
"
"
  I've read this book 4 times now, the first time was in high school and I slept with my light on for a week!!  But it got me hooked on Stephen King, you won't be disappointed!!
"
"
  This book gave me the chills all the way through! All work and no play does make Jack a dull boy!
"
"
  So never watched the movie.  I thought it would give me nightmares.  This is a great book if you want or like scary stories.  Had to keep reading till the end.
"
"
  The book was better. Ready to read the sequel. No one can write a character better than Steven King..
"
"
  Entertaining read.  Some fantasy stuff gets tedious, but overall well worth the read.  If you like the movie, read the book.
"
"
  This is a must read, even if you've already seen the movie.  I finally got around to reading it because I want to enjoy the sequel, Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  My first Stephen King book!
"
"
  My first Kindle book, Stephen King always delivers an awesome story. Next will be the sequel, Doctor Sleep. Can't wait.
"
"
  Why didn't I read this a long time ago.  Mr. King, you are phenomenal!!!  I can't wait to start Dr. Sleep!
"
"
  Have seen the movie several times. The book was 10 times better. On to Dr. Sleep. Will go back read some other books that made the movies ( Carrie and It).
"
"
  Five stars
"
"
  awesome book - I love King's older stuff.
"
"
  What a great read. I should have read it a long time ago.  There were no parts of the book that dragged which can happen at times with SK.
"
"
  Love this book there's just something about a classic Stephen king book that you just can not put down everyone should read it
"
"
  Stephen King cannot be beaten when it comes to building his characters. I come away every time imagining that I have known them for a very long time. This book is excellent and has a fantastic surprise ending.
"
"
  Wonderfully written and thought out. Easy to see why it is one of the most popular stories that King has authored.
"
"
  After not reading the shining since I was 15. I decided that any constant reader worth his/her salt would revisit a story before moving ahead. Still terrifying. Still vivid. Still impossible to forget.
"
"
  I read The Shining years ago. It was fantastic. I recently purchased Dr. Sleep (By Steven King) and wanted to reread The Shining. Dr. Sleep is a continuation of the story which tells of Danny Torrence's life as an adult. Read this. You will not be disappointed!
"
"
  I haven't seen the movie in a while and decided to read this because of the next book. I'm super excited for Dr Sleep!
"
"
  This book never gets old, no matter how many times I read it! One of my favorite stories by King.
"
"
  This classic stands the test of time.  The story is one that stayed with me long after I had finished reading the book!
"
"
  Read this years ago and loved it then! Wanted to revisit it before Dr Sleep came out! As great as i remember it.
"
"
  Spine chilling horror ride! Felt I was hurtling through a long, dark tunnel on top of a locomotive.
"
"
  Loved this book! So freaky and eerie. This book is so awesome, it makes you want to slap whoever made the movie because the two don't compare. Redrum!!!
"
"
  I do read some of Stephen King's books such as The Dome and some others .The Shining is just to far out to be a comfortable read. I had also orderedDoctor Sleep and it will be the same as The Shining, not for me. Stephen KingBooks are very popular reading so the rating I gave it was a personal one.
"
"
  A very good book that was full of surprises and cliffhangers and made me not want to stop reading. One of the best books I have ever read!
"
"
  Maybe this just wasn't for me.  I found I had to push myself to finish this book.  I found several of the concepts such as the tree sculptures coming to life just stupid and wasn't scared at all like I wanted to be and like described in other reviews.  Also the constant dumbed down talk of the internal thoughts of Danny became irritating and was unnecessary and not realistic.  I was pleased that this book was quite different to the movie and having seen the movie did not spoil the book in general or the ending.
"
"
  Excellent King book.
"
"
  A great story that really does blow the movie right out of the water. Great job Mr. King one of my favorites
"
"
  I just recently read the book for the first time and it blew me away even though I have seen the movie over and over again.
"
"
  I love all of Stephen Kings books! my daughter-in-law introduced me to him years ago! I'm addicted. I read everything he writes and re-read several times!!!!
"
"
  Much better than the movie.  As usual Stephen King does a masterful job at pulling you in and then scaring the living daylights out of you.
"
"
  Classic!
"
"
  Always better then the movie, and always a great read especially during the winter when you can really imagine along with the book.
"
"
  The thing I liked most was how well King was able to describe Jack going mad while trying to fight it. You know he's going crazy but you somehow think he's going to overcome it the whole time.
"
"
  I can't believe I never picked this book up before now.  I usually don't enjoy older books with dated material but, the climactic moments had me riveted.
"
"
  I loved how the book was like the actual thing. It was almost like I was actually in the scene with the characters
"
"
  great book I've always loved Stephen king I strongly recommend this for a good read cant wait to read doctor sleep
"
"
  Two thumbs up for The Shining.  Stephen King never fails to impress.  Where he comes up with this stuff is anyone's guess.
"
"
  Excellent, Stephen King always delivers!!!
"
"
  My expectations of the book were underestimated. I absolutely love the book. It was amazing and I got an A+ on my book report on this book. Thanks!!!!
"
"
  I really, really, really loved this book! I never wanted to stop reading it. I liked having it on my kindle because it was easier to carry that around than a huge book.
"
"
  Excellent book. Several spelling mistakes in the kindle edition. Beautiful scenes with the mountain vistas in summer and also fairly terrifying scenes... in winter.
"
"
  It is evenly paced has a great story line and its just undeniably awesome!!!! I highly recommend it to all!
"
"
  Read doctor sleep first. trying to start this one but I have to r s 're it first? torque?  Hopefully it's good.
"
"
  I liked the movie. But it differs in many important ways from the book. The book was entertaining and like most stories, much more vivid and detailed.
"
"
  I read Dr. Sleep and since it is pretty much a sequel to the Shining I had to read it too .....wish I'd read them in the other order though
"
"
  Read this again and again it never gets old and is so much more intense and rewarding then the movie
"
"
  I'm very glad to have finally had the chance to read this masterpiece.  I'm also glad I waited all these years to see the film since the book is always better.
"
"
  I loved it!!!! Best terror book I have ever read.
"
"
  Great book, good plot, well developed characters. kinda freaked me out, which is not an easy feat. I wonder how the movie compares.
"
"
  Great book but a bit of an anti-climax end compared to the rest of the book. Will try another of Mr King soon.
"
"
  One of Stephen King's best!  I loved the book & can't wait to rewatch the movie to see everything they left out!
"
"
  Boring beginning but great at the end now to watch the movie and see how it compares :) and now on to the sequel
"
"
  I chose this rating because It is such a good book, I saw the movie first, but the book goes into Jack's mind.
"
"
  This first Stephen King book I've read. And now I'm hooked. Well written.scary but not over-the-top. We all have demons in us even old hotels.
"
"
  Better than the movie...
"
"
  I am grading this item based on the condition in which it was received and that it was received on time.  I have seen the movie, The Shining, and it was far out.  I have not read this book for I do not read Stephen King.  I ordered this for my grandson for Christmas.
"
"
  I enjoyed this book very much. I have always loved the Stephen King books, but never had time to read them. Now I have that chance and am enjoying it immensely.
"
"
  Eerie book! Bought on my kindle on my smartphone. Downloaded quickly. I will definitely buy another book. Was very pleased.
"
"
  Much better than the movie (although I like the movie too). This book is a quick read and will keep you on your toes.
"
"
  Was scared out of my mind.  Must be getting old?  Had to read it before Dr. Sleep.  Loved It!!  Highly recommend.
"
"
  One of my all time favorite book.Stephen King is a remarkable story teller.
"
"
  I'm so glad I decided to read this book.  It was excellent!  I could not put it down. So wow.
"

  The novel itself is a classic, and one of Stephen King's best early novels. Whereas the Kindle versions of many older King novels are rife with spelling and grammatical errors (a consequence of the scanning and recognition software), this particular version of the Shining is based on a newer reprint. As a result, spelling and grammar are well-done. Recommended.

  Brilliant!

"
  This book is WAY better than the movie (typical, right?)!  The twists & turns at every  moment - I was completely enthralled the whole way through!!!
"
"
  Great book!  Just read it again before reading the sequel <U+0001F603>. Can't  wait to read Dr. Sleep.  Stephen king is the best.
"
"
  I saw the movie growing up.  No one does it like Jack Nicholson.  But, this book is outstanding!  Thank you, Stephen King, for being such an amazing storyteller.
"
"
  Great book! Stephen King has a wild imagination and the book will keep you on the edge of your seat.
"
"
  I said to leave it in the Mail Room
"
"
  This was a very frightening book. I liked it much more than the movie and a must read for any die hard King fan.
"
"
  I always loved the movie still the read is worth it for any King fan. Few suprizes here for movie lovers
"
"
  Such a suspenseful book. Regardless if you liked the movie or not, the book ends quite a bit differently and is definitely worth the read.
"
"
  I've been wanting to read it for years and could never find a copy. I got my kindle and bought it and I am very glad that I did!
"
"
  The book is ALWAYS better than the movie. It gave so much more in depth understanding of all the characters.
"
"
  A classic book that I was looking forward to rereading in preparation of my initial read through the new Doctor Sleep book.
"
"
  This book is gripping and kept me on the edge of my seat till the very end i really felt as if i was there in the overlook. Stephen King Truly made a masterpiece! So much better than the movie. This is a must buy for all!
"
"
  Awesome story
"
"
  One of the best Stephen King's works. It's must-read for any Stephen King reader. Even after seeing the movie, you can be surprised with this amazing history.
"
"
  Never gets old!  A true classic!  Welcome home Mr. Torrance!  Can't wait for Dr. Sleep!  Hurry September, cone quickly!  :-)
"
"
  I absolutely loved this book! I used  to read  all the time, but I stopped a couple of years ago. After I got my kindle,  decided I needed to read again. This was the first book I downloaded and I loved every second of it!
"
"
  Nothing like the movie.  Awesome story line and it was like I had never known it.  Great visual but can get a little wordy
"
"
  Honestly, this is one of the most surreal looks at alcoholism that I've ever read. Looking forward to starting Doctor Sleep next.
"
"
  Great Book
"
"
  Exactly book. My wife loves to read and had never read a Stephen King book now she can't stop.
"
"
  I got nightmares
"
"
  A must read. Movie should have never been made. The novel is much better.
"
"
  Amazing book! This book is suspenseful all of the way through, it is hard to put down! I suppose now it's time I finally see the original movie...
"
"
  Even better than the movie
"
"
  Amazing book I loved how great it was, nothing bad to say about it. Stephen King is my favorite author
"
"
  An amazing experience that keeps you wanting more every second of the day. I've read Stephen King before, but this took terror and insanity to a whole new level.
"
"
  Way better than the movie.
"
"
  You can't go wrong with a King. It was much better than the movie (surprise surprise). Now on to the next.
"
"
  Stephen king will always be the be the best Arthur when it comes to horror books. This book will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time
"
"
  Truly a fun ride you  drawn in and can't put down I did read Doctor Sleep first so answers question about Danny
"
"
  I went back to read this before I read Doctor Sleep and it was better this time. I think I'll read Salem's Lot again.
"
"
  Little boy shines on.Heart pounding. Mallet smashing.Dare I turn the page?Every step he takes so will I.
"
"
  One of the best Stephen King books I've ever read... I had goose bumps through the entire end! A must read book!
"
"
  Ive always been a fan of the movie. But after finally reading this book i feel like that movie did this story the greatest injustice. Amazing book. A must read for King fans
"
"
  I really enjoyed this book
"
"
  Excellent read. My stomach was in knots reading it. Not at all what I expected after seeing the movie. So much h better.
"
"
  This was the second time I've read the book and I enjoyed it more this time.
"
"
  But absolutely Loved the book. That's all that needs to be said! Anyone who's a fan needs to read this!
"
"
  Simply a classic!
"
"
  But I've been a SK fan for a while. I can definitely see where he matured as a writer.  But this was a fun one to read.
"
"
  Stephen King never lets you down!!!!
"
"
  New or classic King, it doesn't matter. The master of horror, twists and page turning plots never gets old, even if the book is...
"
"
  King at his best
"
"
  Good read, believable characters, excellent plot. Classic Stephen king ending that needs more work though. Would recommend to a friend
"
"
  Stephen King has written amazing books in his lifetime, but this is on of his best ones yet! If you are interested in pooping your pants, this is the book for you.
"
"
  I like the book and the movie in their own, separate ways. The book was great and allowed me to create my own suspense within myself.  Great book.
"
"
  I love this book and I would recommend this to all ...Stephen will always remain the KING of Horror!!!
"
"
  Some books are so scary they should only be read once. I should have just given it to my kids :)
"
"
  Epic!
"
"
  Much better than the movie, of course. First bok I've read by Steven King, I'm impressed! Looking forward to the sequel. already have it downloaded.
"
"
  Stephen King at his best! Scary, atmospheric and a classic! The movie didn't do it justice. Can't wait for the next one.
"
"
  This is a great book esp if you like Stephen King. It's a must read! You will be on the edge of your seat once you get into the story which I must say is thrilling from the start.
"
"
  One of the best horror novels.
"
"
  the book displayed more than the movie with jack Nicholson. it gives great details in the book more than the movie.
"
"
  Stephen King at his best!
"
"
  Amazing
"
"
  It was a great gift for my brother and he loves it. I would recommend this book to others as love as they have long attention spans.
"
"
  Could not put it down!
"
"
  Read this when it first came out and have read it several more times since then.  One of my favorites.
"
"
  In all my 60 years I have never read Stephen King. But I love scary stories. This one hit the mark.
"
"
  Love it!
"
"
  Just awesomeness from Mr King, as expected. Can't wait too pick up the sequel and see where it takes me.
"
"
  One of best ghost stories ever written. Period.
"
"
  No words for how great this book is...have been reading it for twenty years.  Now words could do it justice
"
"
  Just a great book.
"
"
  I've always been a fan...but this is my first read of this one..once again not disappointed! Stephen King surely rocks!
"
"
  If you've seen the movie, but never read the book, you need to read the book!  If you are a Stephen King fan and you don't own this book, buy it now.  Stephen King brings his characters to life and he has the ability to make the unbelievable seen real.
"
"
  It is interesting to have read this in conjunction with some of King 's newer work.  The evolution of his writing puts him among the best of our generation.
"
"
  Great read
"
"
  Wow. Just, wow. This book is so much more terrifying and complex than the originalmovie adaptation. Amazingly written. I couldn't put it down!
"
"
  Excellent...couldn't put it down!
"
"
  Great read,very different from movie but worthwhile. Can't put the book down. Every word is more captivating than last. Also recommend if new to King 's writings
"
"
  This book is truly amazing. You will immediately perceive massive differences and omissions that they did not put in the movie
"
"
  I enjoyed reading this book. It's awesome.
"
"
  GREAT BOOK!!!!
"
"
  Stephen King novels are great to read anytime but for some reason it's always been hard to read this one at night. Too many strange noises.
"
"
  Read this long time ago.Never gets old. Ready to read the next chapter of Dan's life. King never disappoints. Better than the movie.
"
"
  Very entertaining. The suspense that only King has. And good ending, something different that king tend to do... Sure a must read
"
"
  king is a masterful writer. I had never read The Shining before but now that I have I c a n say it's definitely better than the movie.
"
"
  It's a great book.
"
"
  10/10
"
"
  This was the first book I read by Steven King . It is a great book. I'm reading it again now and it's even better.
"
"
  if you have never read a king book..this is a great place to start! Highly recommend to all ..the shining!
"
"
  Such a thrilling book. I was so scared I actually wanted to cover my eyes while reading. The visuals in my mind will haunt me forever.
"
"
  If you like being scared this book will certainly do the job. Having seen the movie I could visualize Jack Nicholson but with a rogue mallet instead of an axe,
"
"
  I would like it even if it was a little bit unsettling at some parts of the book that is all
"
"
  AWESOME... Nail biter till the end... Will definitely read again but first on to Dr. Sleep... hoping it is just as good!)
"
"
  Suspenseful and keeps you hooked! This is the first Stephen King book I've read and I was not disappointed.
"
"
  It was very good. I love Stephen King as a writer! It wasn't my very favorite of his but still very good :)
"
"
  Great read. Total page turner. Classic haunting story. If you have seen and like the movie you will love this.
"
"
  kept me enthralled the whole way! A must read! the movie doesn't do this one justice!  can't wait to start the sequel!
"
"
  As always, Stephen king does not disappoint.I enjoyed it more then the movie, which happens to be my favorite scary movie of all time
"
"
  such an amazing book! Buckle your seat belt and enjoy the ride! A classic from King, that doesn't disappoint! So much better than the movie!
"
"
  Best book I have read in a very long time.
"
"
  Although I had seen and loved the movie many times, I hadn't read the book.  I decided to do so prior to reading Doctor Sleep. All I can say is....read the book!
"
"
  One of my all-time faves!
"
"
  Love anything King. All time fav book is the stand second is bag of bones. Have read the shining tons but wanted to read it again before starting Dr sleep
"
"
  Hard to put down. Scary and suspenseful.
"
"
  Read Dr. Sleep first...this filled in all the spaces. Couldn't put it down. Stephen King has a way to keep us spellbound.
"
"
  Stephen King never disappoints me!! He always finds a way to captivate and bring you into the story. Definitely worth reading :)
"
"
  One of King's finest and I've nearly read them all!! His writing has always given a good read, but this gives a great read.
"
"
  I saw the movie first and wondered what the book was like, and I have to say I'm glad I read it.
"
"
  Nice book with a nice story. Awkwardly written, but it only makes you discover more and more about the story. Also, a classic thriller. a must read!
"
"
  This acne o of his classics, and, as always, very good story line! I was on the edge of my seat!
"
"
  Love this book. Followed up with Dr. Sleep
"
"
  Wonderful! Great story and enduring characters. No wonder King wanted to remake the original film. I recommend this to anyone.
"
"
  I have heard great things about  this story for years, and I must say that it lived up to my expectations. Bravo!
"
"
  I couldn't stop reading this book. If you like to be on the edge of your seat this is the book for you! I'm sad it had to end.
"
"
  great book.  it's worth the read even if you've seen the Nicholson movie.  the movie is loosely based on the book.  a bunch of major differences.
"
"
  Great novel. One of King's best. And now if you're wanting more you don't have to wait, just pick up a copy of Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  Awesome book. I saw the movie when I was younger but it doesn't compare to the book.Remember to read it with the lights on.
"
"
  Loved!!!
"
"
  Fantástico book. A must read for sure
"
"
  I absolutely loved this book it was one of the best I have ever read.and that's saying allot since I've read like 500
"
"
  This is a good book.  Once you start reading it it's hard to put down.  It's suspenseful and scary.  I would definitely read this book again
"
"
  great book.
"
"
  Love this!!
"
"
  It is an engrossing story. The characters are well-rounded and believable. I feared for them throughout the book. Definitely scary.
"
"
  overall very well written. occasionally a little slow, but mostly I didn't want to put it down. definitely not for those who scare easily.
"
"
  It was pretty good comfort reading.
"
"
  Classic Stephen King is usually a winner, The Shining being no exception. Scary without being gaudy.
"
"
  Always a good read. Watched the film recently and was able to compare it. Always the book is more enjoyable
"
"
  I've seen the movie a billion times and this is the 1st time I got to read the book. I think that the book is much better. The movie changed a lot of the stuff & added some things that had no explanation. Loved the book, Stanley Kubrick is a moron.
"
"
  I liked this book because it was so scary yet fun at the same time. I would recommend this book to everyone 13 and up. I would rate this book 5 stars
"
"
  Great stuff!
"
"
  One of my favorites of Mr. King's genius novels.
"
"
  Incredible. Much better than the movie. EVERYTHING makes sense now! Loved it.
"
"
  Very captivating book love Stephen King's work can not wait to read Dr Sleep and see where Danny is in his life!
"
"
  Good classic book by Stephen King. You can really tell how he uses the techniques that made him famous. Must read for king fans.
"
"
  Classic and much better than the movie. Be sure to also read Dr Sleep. King is one of my all-time favs.
"
"
  Classic suspense and horror! Steven King keeps you on your toes and gives you a reason to read with the lights on!
"
"
  It kept me glued to the pages, I couldn't put it down. He always is able to have his characters come to life.
"
"
  Great book!!
"
"
  Fantastic like every king book. Recommended for any horror fan. Not a dull moment in the entire book and the ending will blow you away.
"
"
  Heart stopping, nail biting. Pure Stephen King.
"
"
  Good
"
"
  Amazing book, well paced and very suspenseful. I plan to re read this in the future. Amazon wants more words.
"
"
  Like
"
"
  Great book!  If you love Stephen Kings books, you will love this classic.  It is different from Kubricks movie, and as such, a much more in depth,  suspenseful read.
"
"
  Horror with a heart...a well-written, fast-paced story, and believable characters made this story very hard to put down. Highly recommended.
"
"
  Awesome
"
"
  Loved the read on this one
"
"
  Great book!!! Just started reading Doctor Sleep (The Shining part2).
"
"
  Campbell Scott did a great job with his character voices. Stephen king again shows why he is the master at what he does!!
"
"
  this book was a lot better then the movie I recommend this a great read we love it will read it again
"
"
  Could not put this book down. Felt like you were the characters living the horror!
"
"
  I really enjoyed the way King setup this story. The way the terror builds up is brilliant. One of the best horror books ever written
"
"
  One of the most terrifying books I've ever read.
"
"
  Probably  his  best
"
"
  Got the book today thank you so much
"
"
  This book was absolutely amazing.  A really good read that keeps you on your toes. I couldn't put it down

"
"
  This story was scary. I couldn't put it down! A must read!
"
"
  I read this when it first came out and read it again after reading Dr Sleep.  It still hold the test of time
"
"
  Loved this book!
"
"
  Because it's terrifying and scary and well written and suspenseful and strong character development and foreshadowing. Yes yes yes yes
"
"
  Arguably Stephen King's masterpiece.  If all you know is from the movie, you owe it to yourself to read the book.
"
"
  Classic King. Never saw the movie, glad I read the book. Scary, but couldn't put it down. On to the next.
"
"
  I love the suspense that the book brings to me as a reader. The climax was well explained and the resolution was perfectly though out
"
"
  Great book! Like the movie but on steroids! So much more depth to the characters
"
"
  This is the ultimate must-read in the genre. Terrifying to the end. Not recommended reading in desolate hotels or institutions...
"
"
  I truly enjoyed reading the this book.
"
"
  My first Stephen King read and it was a great one.
"
"
  Chapter 18 was so boring lol but the rest of it was fast past but not as scary as anticipated.
"
"
  Absolute masterpiece, perhaps King's very best.
"
"
  Some of King's best work
"
"
  Wanted to reread it before reading Doctor Sleep. Just as exciting and terrifying the second time. Can't wait to start the sequel!!!
"
"
  Wow. This was SO MUCH better than the movie.
"
"
  I love this book.  I can't believe that it took me so long to get around to reading it.  Definitely some of King's best work.
"
"
  Classic book. Loved the characters and the pace of the story. One of Stephen King's great early works. Highly recommend.
"
"
  I loved this book; it was difficult to put down. The Movie is totally different! Someone needs to make a remake of ""The Shining""!!
"
"
  So much deeper than the movie since you can see inside the character's heads. Ending is much better as well! Quick read.
"
"
  Best Steven King Novel I have ever read.  Still a fun read and still one of my favorite books of all time.
"
"
  Great book, no matter how many times I read it. Stephen King delivers and I cannot wait to dive into the next book.
"
"
  I could not put the book down! It had me at the edge of my seat the whole entire time!
"
"
  the very first time I watched the movie I thought what was left out of the book also a different
"
"
  Stephen king is such an amazing writer. it's hard not to get sucked into his books. I read this because I wanted to read doctor sleep. cannot wait to get started!

  STEPHEN KING IS MY FAVORITE AUTHOR, HE NEVER DIS-APPOINTS!!  THIS WAS A MOVIE, BUT READ THE BOOK, SO MUCH MORE TO THE STORY!

  It was a Pretty creepy book, and I enjoyed reading it. It was intense near the end, which I liked.
"
"
  Can't put it down.  It's wonderfully eerie!  Keeps you guessing through each amazing chapter. This is one of Stephen Kings' classic best.

  It's very good, I love how much detail it has versus the movie. There is so much more to the story. Love it!
"
"
  I am loving this book so much, that it made me buy a bunch more, but its totally worth it!
"
"
  I really liked this book once I picked it up I couldn't put it down i read it for like 7 days straight
"
"
  I am shaking ... The way Mr. King writes is so descriptive , that I felt as if I am at the Overlook fighting with Wendy and Danny for our survival.
"
"
  But it turns out that the book adds so much more!  Both the Movie and the book are well done, but are very different.  If you haven't read the book, I highly recommend it!
"
"
  One of my favs.
"
"
  Nothing at all like the movie, which made the book that muchmore exciting. Waited too long to read this masterpiece.
"
"
  Classic Stephen King. One of his bests.
"
"
  Could not put this down
"
"
  Awesome!
"
"
  Excellent character study
"
"
  Its Just Awesome! It takes you on a ride and makes you ask questions about your own sanity. Its a must read.
"
"
  I love this book. The movie does no justice. My favorite author is Stephen king and I look forward to discovering more of his work.
"
"
  One of the best.
"
"
  Great price and a great book.
"
"
  Good
"
"
  loved it
"
"
  Pretty much the s***
"
"
  One of the best books I've ever read
"
"
  cool
"
"
  Very good.
"
"
  Love all King's books
"
"
  Goosebumps. Goosebumps everywhere.
"
"
  Great job
"
"
  Thought it was a little drag.
"
"
  Abruptly amazing!!! I could not stop reading!!! I can't wait to read the sequel!
"
"
  Amazing classic, way better than the movie!
"
"
  One of the best books by King.. This was the 2nd time I read it and I enjoyed the hell of of it
"
"
  I read The Shining after seeing the movie three times.  The movie's only saving grace was Jack Nicholson's chilling performance. Otherwise it was hard to follow.  They definitely butchered the story. The book is much more satisfying, and I plan to read it a coup-le more times to catch up with the movie.
"
"
  Great book!
"
"
  Book was in poor condition when I received it. Spine was tore, corners were bent up. Very disappointed. Even after I read my books they still look new, this book looked like it was used and abused, not new like described.
"
"
  Back in high schooI I remember that I was so tired I could only keep one eye open... but I just couldn't put this book down so I kept reading with only one eye open.  Before reading Doctor Sleep, I wanted to try and relive that memory so I gave The Shining another go.  What fun! Being able to see how King's writing style has grown over the years was also a treat.
"
"
  Great and Scary!
"
"
  This book is actually pretty bad. The most frightening thing about this novel is how many copies it sold. It is unconvincing and overly foreshadowed.
"
"
  Wonderful novel. Words can't describe how great this book was to read.
"
"
  Stephen King is one of my favorite authors. The shining is one of my favorites. I've read it quite a few times, and itstill gives me the shivers.
"
"
  Great
"
"
  Excellent buy!
"
"
  Really enjoyed this book.  Wish I would have tried to read it years ago.  Will definitely re-read.  This book throws you into the middle of all that happens.
"
"
  It was great to read it again! A good prep for dr. Sleep.
"
"
  Good read
"
"
  Stephen King is the supreme story teller.  This book does not disappoint.
"
"
  I read this a long time ago and bought it, simply to own it and reread it.  Spooky and exciting and one of King's best.
"
"
  after reading a seeing the ""under the dome"" I was very disappointed with sk.  ""under the dome""  doesnt have enough plot to be more then one season.
"
"
  The first half of this novel consists of extraordinarily bad writing: commas are placed at random, syntax is butchered in the most sophomoric ways, and King reiterates every sentence at least three times. For instance--this isn't an actual quote; it's just my comic impersonation of the first half of The Shining: ""Jack woke up with a splitting headache. Wow, it hurt like hell. Felt like he'd been hit, with a hammer or something. Except that he hadn't."" The worst of this stylistic redundancy is it mainly appears within streams of consciousness, and a stream of consciousness doesn't ordinarily second-guess itself--in fact it tends to be cryptic or esoteric. Anyway, the second half of this novel is somewhat better--stylistically--resulting in a distinct impression that either (a) parts of the novel may have been ghost written, or (b) Stephen King deliberately wrote the first half of The Shining in the most drawn out, crushingly redundant style he could manage, just so that later scenes might seem to move at a breakneck speed.That much said, nothing in this book was remotely scary--repeat: nothing. Here are some reasons (possibly including a few MILD SPOILERS for the novice) why Kubrick's movie is infinitely more satisfying to the viewer than is King's novel to a thoughtful reader:I. For starters, the movie has Nicholson. Of course, anyone who's already seen the movie will imagine that Book-Jack is Nicholson, too--but, it won't help much, because Book-Jack never speaks with that edgy charm.2. Book-Jack's mental life is steadily revealed in those stream-of-consciousness passages, while Movie-Jack's mind remains impenetrable. Therefore, Movie-Jack's mind can be a source of genuine horror in Kubrick's movie, whereas Book-Jack's mind provides mostly drudgery in Stephen King's book.3. The movie also has Duvall. And you can't pretend that Book-Wendy is Duvall, because, well, because book-Wendy is a blonde, for one thing, and.... Well, that's about it: Book-Wendy isn't a fleshed-out character. She's a blond victim, she's a worried mom, but she's not much more.4. The movie has bent-finger, scratchy-voice Tony, while Book-Tony is not too much more than a state of mind. Whoever figured out how to make Movie-Tony visible and audible left Stephen King lying in the dust!5. The novel, despite a considerably larger cast of not very credible or interesting ghosts, seems to be more concerned with alcoholism than with anything ethereal.6. The novel doesn't have the hedge maze--which, of course, means the novel and the film have different endings. Without adding major spoilers, I can only say that the movie's ending is character-driven, while the novel's is more special-effectsy.7. The novel doesn't have ""Here's Johnny!""8. The novel, despite its large population of ghosts, doesn't have those creepy little girls in it. (Nor does it have the waves of blood.)9. Book-Jack never once works on his manuscript at the Overlook. This of course means that the novel doesn't have ""All work and no play...,"" which again means that Book-Jack's madness isn't so impenetrable.10. In a nutshell, the mental anguish is more intense in the film; conversely, in the novel the physical violence is much more brutal.11. The act or facility of ""shining"" in the novel serves mainly to create suspense--that is, it allows the reader to know things that most characters in the novel do not know. Think here of Hitchcock's bomb-under-the-table: shining makes Book-Danny the kind of ""camera"" that offers the reader a less subjective--which is to say, more omniscient--point of view. Or in other words, shining lets Book-Danny know things that otherwise--without shining--only Stephen King himself could know. In the movie, most of that is brilliantly reversed: movie-shining serves as ""proof,"" within the film, of an alternate reality--or to put this another way, ""shining"" puts Movie-Danny slightly beyond the viewer's comprehension, which also puts Kubrick's cinematic ""world"" beyond our understanding, despite all the evidence presented to our eyes and ears. So, the novel can have a reality-affirming, reassuring conclusion, but the movie cannot.

"
  I just finished kings story, The Shining and loved it, especially toward the end. Now on to the sequel, Dr Sleeeeep!
"
"
  LIKED THIS MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE. GIVE IT A TRY. IT'S A REAL NAIL BITER. IF IT'S BY STEPHEN KING, I'LL BE READING IT.
"
"
  Perfect
"
"
  I have read this book at least four times; I bought this one for my daughter; in my opinion, it is King's best.
"
"
  One of the best books I’ve ever read. Completely recommended! It makes you want to read and never stop. So addictive!
"
"
  Good book
"
"
  Most excellent book ever!  Ebola epidemic foretold by Steven King.  The end of the world is upon us.  Read it & weep!
"
"
  Not everyone is a Stephen King fan. I am and think this is one of his best books. It's a must read in the ""King-dom.""
"
"
  Big Stephen King fan and he wrote a sequel to this, so had to get it out my kindle...scary book
"
"
  Awesome glad I got this item it works great it does the job great. I received this item so quick I was blown away.
"
"
  If I have to telll you how good this book is just type :""Dean Koontz"" in the search bar and move along.
"
"
  Awesome! Puta the movie to shame.
"
"
  Didn't really enjoy reading this that much. This was my first Stephen King story to read. I felt like I was reading babble half the time.
"
"
  Good book!
"
"
  Awesome!
"
"
  Love it!  can't wait to read the sequel!!  if you are stephen king fan you have to read this classic
"
"
  loved the slow throb that built to a furious heartbeat in this story. it's a perfect Halloween season book. definitely one that you will keep your light on for a few nights after.
"
"
  Just watched the movie, which is enough for me.
"
"
  Bought the book brand new and it came with these tears and folds on the front page and a small fold on the back. :/ would have bought it used or something if I knew it would have came like this. As for the book itself, it's Stephen King doing his thing. The book was great. 3/5 for the damages.
"
"
  Package came on time and just as described.  The price was right too.
"
"
  I READ IT TWICE, I DO THAT WITH BOOKS I LIKE ALOT. I READ OTHER BOOKS THEN COME BACK.
"
"
  Dry plot, but the story is drawn out way too long. I was expecting this to be one of the best books I've ever read and was let down. This story could be told without being washed out by nonsense. Not scary or even ""thrilling""
"
"
  I had it sent to my nephew that is in prison and when he writes to me. Tells me he enjoys all of Stephen King's books that I have sent to him.  Love and GODs Blessings, Anita  May GODS Angels continue to watch over you forever and forever, is my prayer.
"
"
  I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I went with too others, one didn't like it, one thought it was pretty good, I didn't know what to think. So I went back and saw it a couple of more times. Each time I saw more and eventually realized it was, typically of Kubrick, one of the more amazing movies ever. Every time he took on a gender, he pushed it to the ultimate. Here is the ultimate psychological horror movie. It has more subtile subconscious moments then you would think possible. And so many intense conscience moments - my favorite is when Shelley Duval discovers what Jack has been writing - that seen just sent chills up and down my spine - and its just some one looking at typed pages.
"
"
  WOW I can read this great hardcover every year without having pages fall out like my 30 year old paper back and dream of REDRUM REDRUM til i scream and wake up sweating and needing drugs and a drink! Is life great or what!
"
"
  I'm sorry to say that the movie was much better. It had some really good scary parts... but then certain elements that were scary were reintroduced in the story and it became comical almost. Bla.
"
"
  The book is amazing. But the cover and book are damaged.
"
"
  I found this book to be a little too creepy for my taste, but . . . . .that said, it was well written and in much detail.
"
"
  The Shining has always been one of my favorite movies but after reading the book I feel like they really didn't do it any justice.
"
"
  i read tgis cause i wanted to read Doctor Sleep, and it was well worth it. my only complaint is that it is one of his early books and has his typical boring first third while doing character development, something i have to say he has become way better at.
"
"
  Great book
"
"
  Glad to have finally read it.
"
"
  Seen the movie
"
"
  Jack Torrance is a character that leaps off the page. I didn't find the novel frightening as much as I felt it disturbing. And that's because of the force of the JT character.
"
"
  Stephen King is always a good read
"
"
  Stephen king a wonderful author. Allah's books are good. I love to read his books. I have almost all his books.
"
"
  Great
"
"
  Anyone looking for a great story can stop here. like most of King's work, one can really relate to all the characters and be wholly immersed in this chilling tale from start to finish.
"
"
  great
"
"
  It was ok...seemed slow to me. I was expecting more after hearing such great things about King. Thought I wouldn't be able to sleep because I would be so scared. That was not the case.
"
"
  If you haven't read itYou are missing out
"
"
  One of Stephen King's best novels. It's all so funny and creepy at the same time. I can't wait to read the long awaited sequel, Doctor Sleep. That will be just equally as good.
"
"
  No other can compare to the horror that is Stephen King!No one else can suck you in, make you stay, (horrified all the while), and reluctantly leave still wishing for more. BRILLIANT!
"
"
  Looks just like new! Glad to have a physical copy of my favorite book now!
"
"
  I found the book very weird.but interesting.
"
"
  Everything was PERFECT! It arrived just in time and the book looks just as good as a brand new book!
"
"
  The book came in perfect condition
"
"
  I respect that it was a classic, but it leaves much to be desired, seriously the only decent part was the woman in the bathtub. In fact I think Mr.King knows it, so he carried her over towards the end of the book. The nut shell version: a haunted hotel gets the caretaker to relapse and drink by materializing the drink and convening him that his wife and kid are against him, so he decides to kill them (a bit extreme for tuff love), the kid telepathically calls for help from the cook that works at the hotel who gets the message many miles away and comes to pick up the boy and his mom just before the hotel  goes up in flames because of a faulty boiler.It was a long and lame read. Let's hope Dr.sleep is a good follow up.
"
"
  I absolutely loved it! Although I love the movie. This book is much better. It tells you much more than the movie did.
"
"
  The book is true Stephen king.  I have been a loyal follower for many years. im happy to see his children are keeping it in the family.
"
"
  My son lost his copy YEARS ago!  I decided it was time to surprise him..and I did.  He began reading immediately!  I love Amazon!!
"
"
  Print is smaller than I like.
"
"
  Disapointed
"
"
  I couldn't put it down. Not even once. One of his best ever. Now for the sequel a little Doctor Sleep.
"
"
  Cool cool v cool v cool cool nice nice cool cool v good v nice v nice nice cool cool. Nice nice. Cool cool.
"
"
  wow is all I can say to this book because that's how good it was, and a thriller. . .
"
"
  it kept me reading the whole time and I would recommend it to anyone. Can't wait to read the sequel.
"
"
  I haven't read it yet but I'm sure if it's better than the book and has some of the inside details from the dark tower then I'll love it.
"
"
  My son enjoy reading it brought it for him
"
"
  A wonderfully haunting story about a seasonal job gone horribly wrong. If you enjoy gothic horror you'll enjoy ""The Shining.""
"
"
  This book was very stressful all the way through.
"
"
  Need i say more...?
"
"
  The movie, in this case, is much, much better than the book, which is obviously rarely the case. What we have here is a good idea by King that was ultimately shaped into a powerful story by Kubrick and his fellows. The so-called lost nuances were lost for a reason -- they are weaknesses in the storyline or are faults within the characters that inhabit it. But anyone who is familiar with early King should not be surprised by this. It took quite some time for his stories to evolve beyond being simply good ideas that would be very good novels if shaped by a more experienced author. To mention just a few examples of the flaws in the story Kubrick fixed: the mallet Jack uses becomes an axe, his boy exhibits a more realistic helplessness, and the absurd hedge monsters and wasp imagery that are present in the book as secondary sources of terror are gotten rid of. The book also tries to present what is happening in Jack's mind as he goes insane, and fails miserably -- very poor writing. Then there is the author flinching at the end of the narrative, which lessens its impact on the reader quite a bit: Jack is The Overlook at the end, not himself, not Danny's father (this is stated explicity), and he does not kill the cook, but only maims him. Kubrick recognized that the truly frightening idea here is not a haunted hotel taking possession of a human body, but a haunted hotel driving a more or less normal man insane.
"
"
  To scary!
"
"
  My first Stephen King book. Very far fetched. Skipped over many pages and didnt lose the gist. Wouldnt read another by him
"
"
  I specifically ordered this book because I liked the picture of the cover.  I received the book, and it is a different picture.  I am not happy, as this was a gift for someone special.
"
"
  I've never been a fan of Stephen.  But then I came across The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption and, above all, 11-22-63!  So I thought to give the earlier stuff another shot.A mistake.  He's clearly a terrific writer with an amazingly intricate imagination.  But when he goes to 'real horror', it's just too much.  You have to be a fan of the genre, and I'm not.
"
"
  Bought for my daughter in law. She loves Stephen King Books!!!
"
"
  Sometimes I read mindless entertainment.  I've read Stephen King years ago; but he's still not Edgar Allan Poe.  Poe remains the master.
"
"
  I needed this book for my gothic literature class, and it came in the mail a few days after I ordered it in perfect condition. Thank you very much!!
"
"
  Bought this book as a present to my friends birthday, I'm really thinking of keeping this book for myself. I've seen the movie. The shipping very fast. Plenty of time to read it.
"
"
  The cover is different then what was received.  I hope when it is opened and read after Christmas it is the same book.  I am not sure why it would be different.  Was a little worn but overall what was promised in the description of the product.
"
"
  Shipped quickly. Perfect condition. five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty.
"
"
  This was my first King horror book, and will be my last.  (I had previously read 11-23-63).  I was looking to be horrified or scared, but sadly, while an acceptable psychological thriller, it was not the genius that I had expected.  The setting was great, an hold hotel with a past that was abandoned for the winter.  The rest, very predictable.
"
"
  love it
"
"
  This book sucked. The ideas and themes were interesting sometimes, but the writing was awful. Let me give some examples.""Whimpering with fear, she began to pull herself upwards again. Ten steps, a dozen, a baker's dozen.""Stephen King seems to be full of these little things, call them puns or quirks or flaws, they're everywhere, and they're totally stupid and distract from what otherwise might be a passably interesting story.Also, he puts parentheses in the middle of sentences explaining things that are obvious already. He does this constantly, sometimes up to five times a page.Other examples include Wendy being ""Afraid he would pop up like a jack-in-the-box--pun intended."" Why in god's name would Wendy, clutching a knife and afraid her husband is going to murder her, be making puns?Another gem: ""A nightmare flood of thoughts flooding through his mind in a split second.""The action was good and easy enough to make me keep reading, but I found myself groaning more often in annoyance than fear.
"
"
  Would be better without the distracting racist bits, but overall - King's best.  Tension build to the point of climax.  So much better than the movie.  Loved it!
"
"
  The Shining is one of the best horror stories that I have ever read.  It is Stephen King at his finest.  I read this book about 25 years ago and it terrified me, and of course I have also seen the movie with Jack Nicholson a bunch of times over the years since reading the book.  When I found out that Stephen King was publishing a sequel to The Shining this year, I wanted to prepare, so I dove back into re-reading The Shining and found that there was much that I did not recall about the book's intricacies regarding plot and characters, and tons of things that were very different from the movie, which had become ingrained into my mind as the mainstay over the years.  To be honest, re-reading The Shining terrified me all over again in 2016 and it was so awesome – I experienced a truly freaked-out, page turning, frightened, jumping-at-shadows-late-at-night-in-my-own home horror-lover's bliss!  I am still trying to pinpoint which characters and moments in the book scared me the most and I can't do it because there were so many.  What a ride!  I can honestly attest to the old cliché that the book is way better than the movie.  If you've never read The Shining, you are in for a real treat.  If you are considering re-reading The Shining, please do so, by all means, I promise you will not be disappointed!
"
"
  Livro muito estranho difícil entendimento. O filme é mais interessante. Muito complexo  e não fácil  de ser uma leitura agradável.
"
""
"
  Book was ok.
"
"
  Give me an option on a free book and i will be glad to give you my comments on the book.
"
"
  I'm a big Stephen King, but I hate The Shining. It is a clunker of a vehicle that stalls, jerks forward, then stalls again. Couldn't finish reading it.
"
"
  You know a book is bad when you go into it thinking you'll enjoy it. Then you try again and you still hate it. Its total drivel with a whole lot of writing that amounts to nothing. People who enjoy it need to be lobotomized...
"
"
  My first and last reading a  Stephen King book.
"
"
  honestly i kept reading chapter by chapter waiting for this book to get interesting.
"
"
  This book came with the beginning 9 pages missing.
"
"
  This book DRAGGED on. If you're into books with a lot of action and suspense - this is not the book for you. This was my first Stephen King book and I was very disappointed. I was expecting something more past paced.
"
"
  I ordered this copy of The Shining because of the cover art it is posted with. I had rented this publishing of the novel from the library and I really liked the sizing of the letters and the book itself. When it arrived, it was a cheap, shiny gold book with very small printing.
"
"
  I did not order this
"
"
  Delivery for a stock item should be quicker.
"
"
  I tried twice in my life to get into this book; just can't do it.  I'm disappointed this time as I wanted to read it before the sequel come out.  Sigh.
"
"
  The book is missing pages at the end. I don't know how the story ends which is extremely frustrating, probably the worst cliffhanger of all time. Missing about 30 pages at the end, I don't know if it is a misprint or if this happens often, but I am very disappointed.
"
"
  I would not recommend this book. The only reason I finished reading it is because I paid for it. It dragged so badly; I feel like nothing was happening throughout the entire book (besides the author describing the setting, past, flashbacks and other things over and over and over and over and over) until the last 15% of the book. I will not read another SK book. I tried to read ""IT"" by SK and it was written the same way. I was bored to death and couldn't finish it. No offense to you Mr. SK, this just wasn't my cup of tea.
"
"
  The Kindle formatting for this 5 star book is so faulty that it makes it difficult / impossible to read.  Text appears as one character per line at any size over 8.  At text size 7 and below you can read it but the margins are very wide making it impractical in two column reading mode.  This book needs to be reformatted and then made available for download by those of us who paid for the broken version.
"
"
  This was the first ""horror"" and Stephen King novel I ever read and frankly I wasn't impressed. I was hoping I would get scared. Maybe I put too much anticipation into it. But I just found all the characters annoying and wishing this book would hurry up and end. I only finished the book because I hate not finishing a book, but in the end I have no desire to ever read it again.
"
"
  terribly written
"
"
  I don't remember ordering this...
"
"
  It Is in really bad shape And not the same cover as the one announced
"
"
  Too long and boring
"
"
  It's not THAT scary as its portrayed. At the end, it's not about ghosts at all. It's about a stupid man.
"
"
  Gave as gift.
"
"
  I just didn't like it. Not one of King's best.
"
"
  I've tried several times to read this book, but cannot begin to understand what it is all about, and still have not read the whole book.  Maybe it's just me, but it doesn't hold my interest enough to finish it.
"
"
  For some reason, I can't seem to keep reading this book. After watching the movie, I was really excited to read the book and maybe answer some questions I had. But the book is just boring and confusing. I am about to give up reading it.
"
"
  Just finished re-reading this after many years and discovered it is still a page-turner! Couldn't put it down. A classic horror story that keeps you on edge.
"
"
  Nullifies all rules of my 'theory of novel writing'. Makes them amorphus.
"
"
  Couldn't finish it. I like a good mystery but this seemed too deep and depressing for me
"
"
  I watched the movie years ago when I was a little girl. I thought that maybe the book would be better than the movie so i purchased it. I read two chapters before giving up on finishing it. I think the two paragraphs covering how to maintain the heat from the furnace killed it for me. Since I've seen the movie I feel that there's really no need to finish the book. I might finish it one day but right now I'm not too worried about it.
"
"
  Overly complicated bizzare horror story. Way too much flux between supposed reality and sci-fi. I just could not connect.
"
"
  I had high expectations from this book. It did not scare me at all. I read at night, alone, while living in a frigging creepy hotel. I really wanted to be scared and this legendary book let me down big time. I didn't even get goosebumps, and this is supposed to get my blood boiling, seriously? More Stephen King, no thanks please!
"
"
  Few of the pages were not stuck properly and binding appeared to be poor
"
"
  I am not a big Stephen King fan. This book serves exactly as my reason I am not a fan. Anyone who uses five or six upside down exclamation points and then a phrase and then five or six right side up exclamation points (the same for question marks!) Would not be able to get away with it in my ninth grade creative writing class! In my mind, this was just written to make money. There  is no imagery. The style is juvenile. I can't really call this literature.
"
"
  Didn't like this book dragged too much and I'm a fan focused on too many things at the same time
"
"
  was bought as a gift.
"
"
  I consider this novel, The Shining, to actually be 2 novels in one. It is my first Steven King novel and it is the last Steven King novel. I really enjoyed the page that said, ""The End"". It is filled with psychoanalysis of the characters time after time after time. I guess that the author didn't know what else to do to make the novel longer. There were about 10 paragraphs that held my attention, but they were very few and very, very, very far apart. It is this kind of trash that makes me want to stop reading, but it will take more than this insipid author's attempts to make me stop. Remember, this is just one man's opinion and NOT a national survey. I am just thankful that other authors can make this author pale.
"
"
  Great book I read this in one day couldn't put it down,.  I read every thing I can find by Stephen king
"
"
  SUPER lame book and hardly has any ""horror"" from the movie....... Besides I found the characters to be confusing and very dull. Definitely not worth it but it's your choice:(
"
"
  Yet another good work of Stephen King. Enjoying.
"
"
  This is a great book. I know it’s old, I’m just late coming to the party. It’s a little slow in the beginning like most of Stephen King’s books are but it always pays off in the end. I felt the ending was a little lack lustered. But it has to end somehow. I truly enjoyed this book, it is totally worth the read. Now it’s time to watch the movie.
"

  My husband and I are both big Stephen King fans so of course we had to get this classic! I haven't finished it yet, but am reading it currently. Even within the first chapter I was blown away. It is well-written, like all of his other works.Whether you're just a fan of his books, or a fan of the movie I would recommend giving this one a read, you won't be disappointed.

  This is another wonderful adventure in the World of Steven King.I always love to go there and sometimes never wish to come back!

  I've never seen the movie or read this book. It was great! Stephen King is the master of horror! My only complaint is that the child was 5.

  Mixed up with Dead Zone I read them in 2-days or I should say 2-nights. Who needs sleep with these classics.

  Kubrick did this book NO justice! It contains so many more details and even some key points that were never brought up in the movie. I love this book, I love King and I hope he puts out more books throughout the years.

  I love the book so much more than the movie.  I enjoyed reading the book and then watching the movie again to see the differences.
