# Amazon reviews web scraping

This repo contais a small R program to scrap reviews from any amazon product, and store those reviews as a csv. 

I have used "The Shining" book by Stephen King as an example (last book I've read), but the code can be changed to scrap any other prodcut! In fact, with some more changes, it can be used to scrap text from any kind of review's website.

There's also a small demo in Python on how that text data could be used. In this case, I've used text model that I have already trained. It's located inside the models directory.
